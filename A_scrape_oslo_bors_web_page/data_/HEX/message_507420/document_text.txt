Reference is made to the announcement on 5 April, 2017, in which Hexagon
Composites ASA (the "Company") announced the grant of 1,640,000 share options to
employees under its employee share option program, each at a strike price of NOK
27 per share. Of the 1,640,000 options, 1,175,000 options were granted to senior
executives and managers listed as primary insiders.

The options may be exercised in part or in full within three weeks following the
official announcement of the financial results for the fourth quarter of 2019,
first quarter of 2020 and second quarter of 2020.

Pursuant to the grant, an entitled employee in said share option program has
exercised a total number of 20,000 of said options. The Company has resolved to
settle the economic value of the exercised options through transfer of shares
held in treasury and has therefore initiated the transfer of 6,003 treasury
shares to the employee as settlement of the exercised options. After the
transaction, the Company will hold 1,927,995 treasury shares.
