29 August 2022: The Board of Directors of Hexagon Composites ASA ("Hexagon
Composites" or the "Company") has decided to provisionally award up to 175,000
Restricted Share Units ("RSUs") under a Long-Term Incentive Program (LTIP) to
align the interests of the participating employees with those of the Company's
shareholders.

The RSU allocation is in accordance with the Board of Director's compensation
policy for the executive management. This policy is described in the Company's
Guidelines for remuneration of executive management as approved at the Annual
General Meeting on 28 April 2021.

The RSUs are non-transferable and will vest on 29 August 2025 given that the
participants are still rendering services to the company throughout the period
from Grant date to Vesting date. Each vested RSU will give the holder the right
to receive one share in the Company at an exercise price corresponding to the
par value of the shares being NOK 0.10.

The total number of outstanding restricted share units and PSUs are now 383,852
and provisionally 5,028,864 respectively. Of the maximum 175,000 provisionally
awarded RSUs, maximum 10,000 RSUs will provisionally be awarded to primary
insiders.

Further details of the primary insider's transaction pursuant to the market
abuse regulation article 19 is attached.
