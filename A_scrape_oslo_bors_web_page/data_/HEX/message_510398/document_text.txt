The Board of Directors of Hexagon Composites ASA ("Hexagon Composites" or the
"Company") has decided to provisionally award up to 70 000 Restricted Share
Units ("RSUs") under a Long-Term Incentive Program (LTIP) to align the interests
of the participating employees with those of the Company's shareholders.

The RSU allocation is in accordance with the Board of Director's compensation
policy for the senior executive management. This policy is described in
"Declaration to the Annual General Meeting of Hexagon Composites ASA concerning
determination of Salary and other remuneration to the CEO and other Management",
which were approved at the Annual General Meeting on 22 April 2020 (the "AGM").

The RSUs are non-transferable and will vest on 28 July 2023 given that the
participants are still rendering services to the company throughout the period
from Grant date to Vesting date.

Each vested RSU will give the holder the right to receive one share in the
Company at an exercise price corresponding to the par value of the shares being
NOK 0.10.

The total number of outstanding options, RSUs and PSUs are now
1 200 000, 219 994 and 4 582 675, respectively.

Of the maximum 70 000 awarded RSUs, 7 000 RSUs has provisionally been awarded to
