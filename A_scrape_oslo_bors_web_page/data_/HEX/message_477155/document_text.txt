to  its shareholders  meeting that  Flakk Composites  AS shall  demerger certain
assets  to two entities to be incorporated  as part of the demerger, included in
which  are 25 000 000 shares in  Hexagon Composites ASA.  Flakk Composites AS is
wholly  owned by Flakk Gruppen AS, a company owned 98.7% by Knut Flakk, chairman
of the board of Hexagon Composites ASA. Flakk Composites AS will change its name

After,  and subject  to, completion  of the  demerger Flakk  Rollon AS will hold
4 340 504 shares  (2,37%) of  the total  number of  shares in Hexagon Composites
ASA,  whilst Flakk Composites AS (acquiring  entity 1, to be established) and KF
Finans AS (acquiring entity 2, to be established), which will be incorporated as

(10,91%)  and  5 000 000 shares  (2,73%),  respectively,  of the total number of
shares in Hexagon Composites ASA.
