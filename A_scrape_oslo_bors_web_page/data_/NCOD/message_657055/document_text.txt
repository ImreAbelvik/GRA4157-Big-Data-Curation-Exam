The board of directors of Norcod AS (the "Company") has approved a new
long-term incentive programme ("LTIP") for the Company's executive management

management with those of the company's shareholders.

In addition, 38,800 shares from the Company's Treasury were approved for
transfer to primary insider Christian Riber as partial settlement of the
previous incentive agreement.

Through the new programme the management is offered to purchase up to 150,000
ordinary shares, set to NOK 12.5 per share, or a total of MNOK 1,875. The
strike price of the share options is calculated based on the volume-weighted
average share price last 30 days preceding the establishment of the programme.

Tranche 1: Up to 50,000 shares are considered vested on 31 December 2025.
Tranche 2: Up to 50,000 shares are considered vested on 31 December 2026.
Tranche 3: Up to 50,000 shares are considered vested on 31 December 2027.

The total number of share options awarded under the programme is 450,000. Each
share option awarded in the programme gives the right to subscribe for and be
allotted one share in the Company. Vested share options may be exercised by
the management at any time during the period from 1 January 2028 to 30 April
2028. The share options will lapse if not exercised by 30 April 2028.
