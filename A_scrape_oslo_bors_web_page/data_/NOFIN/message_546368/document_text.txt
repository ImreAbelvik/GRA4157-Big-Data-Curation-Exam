Reference is made to the completed rights issue (the "Rights Issue") in Aega ASA ("Aega" or the "Company") regarding issuance of units, each consisting of one new share in the Company with the addition of two warrants (together referred to as "Units"). The Rights Issue and the Units are further described in previous stock exchange announcements published by the Company, including 31 August 2021, 13 October 2021 and 28 October 2021.  

Following completion of the Rights Issue, payment for a total of 36,643 Units were overdue and not settled. Hence, these Units have been re-allocated pursuant to the terms set out in the prospectus prepared in connection with the Rights Issue and at a price equal to the subscription price of NOK 1.50 in the Rights Issue. 

All 36,643 Units are now re-allocated to K Hjellnes-Polyteknikk AS, a company which has the same chairperson of the board as Aega, Halldor Chr. Tjoflaat.
