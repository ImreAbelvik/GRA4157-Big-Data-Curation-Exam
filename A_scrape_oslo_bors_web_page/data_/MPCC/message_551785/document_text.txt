Oslo, 21 January 2022 - MPC Container Ships ASA ("MPCC" or the "Company")
announces that it has agreed with MPC Capital Beteiligungsgesellschaft mbH & Co.
KG to settle, by way of repurchase and cancellation, a total number of 1,870,302
outstanding and vested warrants. Each warrant gives the right to subscribe for
one MPCC share at a subscription price of USD 1.89, and the warrants are
acquired by MPCC for a total consideration of USD 2,219,481, i.e. at a 3%
discount to their intrinsic value based on the 10 days volume weighted average
price of the MPCC shares. Shareholdings of MPC Capital and its related parties
in MPCC remain unchanged following the transaction.

By repurchasing and cancelling these warrants, no new shares will be issued. The
repurchase price is expected to be overcompensated in less than 1.5 years by
avoiding dilution of existing shareholders. Following the cancellation of the
warrants, there are no longer any outstanding warrants relating to MPCC shares.

section 5-12 of the Norwegian Securities Trading Act.
