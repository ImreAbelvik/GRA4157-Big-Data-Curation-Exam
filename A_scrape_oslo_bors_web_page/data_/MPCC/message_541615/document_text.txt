announces that it has agreed with MPC Capital Beteiligungsgesellschaft mbH & Co.
KG to settle, by way of repurchase and cancellation, a total number of 3,740,604
outstanding and vested warrants. Each warrant gives the right to subscribe for
one MPCC share at a subscription price of USD 1.89, and the warrants are
acquired by MPCC for a total consideration of USD 3,553,574, i.e. at a 3%
discount to their intrinsic value based on the 10 days volume weighted average
