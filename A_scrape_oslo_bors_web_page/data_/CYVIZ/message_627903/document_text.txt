16.9.2024 15:14:24 CEST | Cyviz | Mandatory notification of trade primary
insiders

Cyviz AS (the "Company") has launched a combined share purchase and option
program (the "Program") for employees. The Program gave employees the right to
subscribe for shares in the Company with an 11% discount of the volume-weighted
average trading price of the Company's shares during a subscription period that
started on 30 August 2024 and ended on 13 September 2024 at 16:30 hours (CEST),
which equals a subscription price of NOK 27.44 per share. The shares are subject
to a 12-month lock-up period during which the shares are restricted from sale.
Moreover, every fourth share acquired by an employee under the Program that is
still held on January 15, 2026, gives the employee an option to acquire one
additional share in the Company at the nominal value of the shares, NOK 1.10,
contingent on the employee still being employed with the Company.

In total, 54,964 shares were subscribed and have been allocated by the Company's
board of directors to employees under the Program. In addition to this, a former
employee in the Company has exercised 20,000 options, giving the right to
subscribe for 20,000 shares in the Company at a strike price of NOK 26.70. 

On this background, the Company's board of directors has resolved to issue
74,964 new shares in the Company and increase the Company's share capital by NOK
82,460 in accordance with the board authorization to increase the Company's
share capital in connection with share incentive programs granted by the
Company's annual general meeting on 16 May 2024.

Following registration of the share capital increase with the Norwegian Register
of Business Enterprises, the Company's new share capital will be NOK 14,256,614
divided on 12,969,558 shares each with a nominal value of NOK 1.10. The share
capital increase will be registered with the Norwegian Register of Business
Enterprises as soon as practically possible after the share contributions have
been paid in full.
