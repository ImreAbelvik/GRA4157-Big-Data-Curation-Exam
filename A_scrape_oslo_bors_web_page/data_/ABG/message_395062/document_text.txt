ABG Sundal Collier Holding ASA today announced its 
annual share incentive program for partners. Under the 
program, new and existing partners are given the 
opportunity to acquire restricted partner shares. The 
price of the shares is based on the volume weighted 
price for the last 30 days less a discount of 15% 
reflecting the restrictions imposed on partner shares. 
The price after the discount is NOK 5.03 per share, 
but the price will also be adjusted for the proposed 
dividend to shareholders for the year 2015 because the 
shares will be issued after the AGM to be held on 26 
April 2016. The proposed dividend to shareholders for 
the year 2015 is NOK 0.60 per share.  

The program for 2016 involves up to 10 million shares 
either as cash subscription at NOK 5.03 per share or 
at a price of NOK 5.28 per share when covered by 
forward contracts for settlement on 1 June 2019. The 
prices are before adjustment for the proposed dividend 
for the year 2015.

Current and new partners within the firm will be 
offered to subscribe for shares under the program. A 
final allocation will be decided and announced as soon 
as completed at latest 8 March 2016.
