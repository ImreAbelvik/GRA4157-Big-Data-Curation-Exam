ABG Sundal Collier Holding ASA today announced its 
annual share incentive program for partners. Under 
the program, new and existing partners are given the 
opportunity to acquire restricted partner shares. 
The price of the shares is based on the volume 
weighted price for the last 30 days less a discount 
of 15% reflecting the restrictions imposed on 
partner shares. The price after the discount is NOK 
4.20 per share, but the price will also be adjusted 
for the proposed dividend to shareholders for the 
year 2014 because the shares will be issued after 
the AGM to be held on 29 April 2015. The proposed 
dividend to shareholders for the year 2014 is NOK 
0.50 per share plus an extra-ordinary dividend of 
NOK 0.50 per share.  

The program for 2015 involves up to 10 million 
shares either as current subscriptions at NOK 4.20 
per share or at a price of NOK 4.41 per share when 
covered by forward contracts for settlement on 1 
June 2018. The prices are before adjustment for the 
proposed dividend for the year 2014.

Current and new partners within the firm will be 
offered to subscribe for shares under the program. A 
final allocation will be decided and announced as 
soon as completed, at latest 6 March 2015.
