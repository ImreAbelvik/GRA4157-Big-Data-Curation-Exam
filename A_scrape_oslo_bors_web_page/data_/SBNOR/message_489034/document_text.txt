Reference is made to stock exchange notice 31 October 2019 regarding a program for employees for acquisition of equity certificates (the «SVEG Program»). 

Upon expiry of the offer period on 8 November 2019, Sparebanken Vest has received subscriptions for equity certificates corresponding to a value of NOK 12,480,000, including subscriptions by primary insiders. 

The offer period in the bank’s ordinary savings program for employees («the Savings Program») has run alongside the offer period in the SVEG Program. Upon expiry of the offer period in the Savings Program, Sparebanken Vest has received subscriptions for equity certificates corresponding to a value of NOK 5,925,000, including subscriptions by primary insiders. 

In both programs, Sparebanken Vest has therefore received subscriptions for equity certificates corresponding to a value of NOK 18,405,000 in total. The attached list shows amounts subscribed for by primary insiders.

The price to be paid per equity certificate will in both programs be settled on or about 21th november 2019. Allocation will take place on or about 11th December 2019. Allocation will be from the bank’s own holding of equity certificates. A complete notification of trade by primary insiders and the bank’s own holding will therefore be given in connection with allocation.
