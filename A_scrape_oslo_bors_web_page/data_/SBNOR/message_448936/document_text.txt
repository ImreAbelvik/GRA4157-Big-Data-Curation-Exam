Reference is made to previous stock exchange notices regarding the General Meeting's resolution to carry out a dividend issue/equity capital increase (the «Dividend Issue»). 

The subscription period in the Dividend Issue expired on 17 April 2018 at 16:30 hours. Upon expiry of the subscription period, Sparebanken Vest has received subscriptions from primary insiders as shown in the attached overview. 

In accordance with the terms of the Dividend Issue, the primary insiders have subscribed for the full amount they would otherwise receive as ordinary dividend for the financial year 2017. The number of new equity certificates to be issued to them and their total holding will first be determined once the subscription price has been settled, which will take place on 18 April 2018. A complete notification of trade will therefore be given later today, together with information on the subscription price and the result of the Dividend Issue.
