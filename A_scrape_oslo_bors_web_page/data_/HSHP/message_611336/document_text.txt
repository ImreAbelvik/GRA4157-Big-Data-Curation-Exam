Hamilton, Bermuda, February 20, 2024

In September 2021, the Board established a long-term incentive plan for the
Group's directors and other key human resources (the "LTI Plan") and approved a
set of general rules for the LTI Plan. Furthermore, the Board allocated 800,000
of the Company's authorised but unissued share capital as settlement of the
exercised options granted under the LTI Plan.

The Board has resolved to grant 115,000 share options to key human resources and
one director under the Company's LTI Plan. Each share option gives the holder
the right to purchase one share in the Company at an exercise price of USD 8.00.
The share options will vest over a period of three years and expire five years
after the grant date.

Following the grant, the total number of outstanding share options is 761,000.

The following primary insider was granted options:

Jehan Mawjee (Director), was granted 50,000 options, following which she holds
in total 50,000 options.
