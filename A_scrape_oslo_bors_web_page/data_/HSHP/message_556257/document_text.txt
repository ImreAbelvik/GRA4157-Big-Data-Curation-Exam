Hamilton, Bermuda, March 11, 2022

In September 2021, the Board established a long-term incentive plan for the
Group's directors and other key human resources (the "LTI Plan") and has
approved a set of general rules for the LTI Plan. Furthermore, the Board has
allocated 800,000 of the Company's authorised but unissued share capital as
settlement of the exercised options granted under the LTI Plan.

The Board has resolved to grant 120,000 share options to key human resources
under the Company's LTI Plan. Each share option gives the holder the right to
purchase one share in the Company at an exercise price of USD 8.00. The share
options will vest over a period of three years and expire 5 years after the
grant date.

Following the grant, the total number of outstanding share options is 620,000.
