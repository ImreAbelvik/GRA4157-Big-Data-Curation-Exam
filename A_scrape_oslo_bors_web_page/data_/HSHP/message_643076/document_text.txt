Hamilton, Bermuda, April 4, 2025

The Board of Himalaya Shipping Ltd. ("Himalaya" or the "Company") adopted the
framework for a long-term incentive plan for the Company's directors and other
key human resources (the "LTIP") in September 2021. On April 3, 2025, the
Board approved to increase the reserve of the Company's authorised but
unissued share capital by 450,000, which is to be used as settlement upon
exercise of the share options granted under the LTIP. Under this amendment,
the maximum aggregate number of common shares that may be delivered pursuant
to any and all awards under the LTIP was increased from 800,000 to 1,250,000,
subject to adjustment due to recapitalization or reorganization as provided
under the LTIP. The LTIP provides for the grant of share options and other
awards as determined by the Board of Directors in its sole discretion.

In addition, the Board has now resolved to grant in total 200,000 share
options to key management resources of the Company under the LTIP. Each share
option gives the holder the right to purchase one share in the Company at an
exercise price of US$7.50. The share options will cliff vest three years from
the grant date and expire 5 years from the grant date.

Following the grant, the total number of available share options under the
LTIP are 250,000 and the total number of outstanding share options in the
Company is 1,000,000.  

The following primary insiders were granted share options:

-  Lars-Christian Svensen (Contracted CEO) was granted 120,000 share options,
following which he holds in total 185,000 share options and 19,186 shares in
the Company.

-  Vidar Hasund (Contracted CFO) was granted 20,000 share options, following
which he holds in total 120,000 share options in the Company.
