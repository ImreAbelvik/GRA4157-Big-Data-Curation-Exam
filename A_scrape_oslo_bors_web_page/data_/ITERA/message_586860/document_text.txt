The board of Itera ASA has on 20 March 2023 approved the issuance a share purchase and option programme as long-term incentives for key employees in the company, in addition to a general employee share purchase programme, pursuant to a mandate given by the general meeting on May 24, 2022. Transaction date is 30 March 2023. 

The extended share purchase program for has restriction on sales for a period of 3 years. The restriction period is considered to be a value-reducing element equivalent to a European put option. If the employee terminates his/her employment with the company before the end of the restriction period, the company has an option to repurchase the shares at a value corresponding to the then current market price minus the original NOK value of the value-reducing restriction period. The subscription price of NOK 9.63 per share is set at the volume weighted average for the last ten trading days (10-23 March 2023) before the subscription period of NOK 12.59 per share, less the discount value of the restriction period, which is calculated at NOK 2.96 per share. A total of 31 employees subscribed to a total of 469,768 shares.

The general employee share purchase programme has a similar structure and price, with the exception of no repurchase option by the Company in the event the employee resigns during the restriction period. A total of 85 employees subscribed for 177,941 shares. 

A new share option programme of 305,000 options and a vesting period of up to four years was issued.

The exercise price for the options is NOK 12.59, which is equal to the average volume-weighted transaction price on the Oslo Stock Exchange for the period 10-23 March 2023. The exercise price is not adjusted for any dividend payments in the vesting period. 

The options can be exercised at the following times:

- with up to 1/3 of the options during the period 16.03.2026-30.03.2026
- remaining options during the period 16.03.2027-30.03.2027

Options that are not exercised within the first exercise period are rolled forward to the next exercise period. The exercising of options is contingent on the employee not having terminated his/her employment at the time of exercise.
