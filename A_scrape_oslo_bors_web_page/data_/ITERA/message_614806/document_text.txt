On 14 February 2024, the Board of Directors of Itera ASA approved an extended share purchase programme and an option program for key employees in the company as long-term incentives, in addition to a general share purchase program for employees, in accordance with the authorisation granted by the Annual General Meeting on 24 May 2023. The transaction date is March 31, 2024. 

The extended share purchase program has a lock-in period of 3 years. The lock-in period is considered to be a value-reducing element similar to a European put option. If the employee leaves the company before the end of the lock-in period, the company has an option to buy back the shares at a value corresponding to the prevailing market price less the original NOK value of the lock-in period. The subscription price of NOK 9.50/share is set at a volume-weighted average for the last ten trading days (February 27 - March 11, 2024) before the subscription period, equal to NOK 12.31 per share, less the value of the lock-in period calculated at NOK 2.81/share. A total of 29 employees subscribed for 376,320 shares. 

The general share purchase program has a similar structure and price, except that there is no repurchase option for the company if the employee leaves during the lock-in period. A total of 59 employees subscribed for 134,496 shares. 

A new option program was issued for a total of 600,000 options with a duration of up to 4 years.  The strike price for the options in Itera is NOK 12.31, which is based on the average volume-weighted transaction price on the Oslo Stock Exchange from 27 February to 11 March 2024. The strike price is not adjusted for dividend payments during the vesting period. 

The options can be redeemed at the following times:  

-	with up to 1/3 of the options in the period 16.03.2027-30.03.2027
-	remaining options in the period 16.03.2028-30.03.2028

Options that are not redeemed in the initial redemption period are automatically rolled over to the next redemption period. 

Redemption of options is conditional on the employee being in an undismissed position in the Group at the time of redemption.
