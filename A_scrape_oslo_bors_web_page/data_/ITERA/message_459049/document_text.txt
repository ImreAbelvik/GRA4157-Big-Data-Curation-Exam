Itera ASA has issued a share purchase programme for key employees in the company, pursuant to a power of attorney given by the general meeting on 22 May 2018. The programme is a new long-term incentive programme instead of previously used stock option programmes. The shares have a restriction on sales for a period of 3 years. The restriction period is considered to be a value-reducing element equivalent to a European put option. If the employee terminates his/her employment with the company before the end of the restriction period, the company has an option to repurchase the shares at a value corresponding to the then current market price minus the original NOK value of the value-reducing restriction period. The subscription price of NOK 8.44 per share share is set to the volume-weighted average the last 10 trading days prior to the subscription period, less the original NOK value of the restriction period.

In total, Itera ASA has sold 972,377 shares at a price of NOK 8.44 to a total of 22 employees in the company. New total holding is 1,242,165 shares.
