As reported in its third quarter 2015 report, Questerre has 
implemented further overhead reductions to maintain its 
financial 
flexibility in the current commodity price environment.

Effective November 1, 2015, the Board of Directors has 
implemented a 
20% reduction in the number of working days from five to 
four per 
week. As a result, annual salaries for officers and 
employees have 
been reduced by 20%. This is in addition to the 10% 
reduction 
implemented in the first quarter of 2015.
 
Additionally, the Board of Directors has reduced their fees 
by 10%. 
This is also in addition to the 10% reduction implemented in 
the first 
quarter of this year.
