Reference is made to the stock exchange notice published by Agilyx ASA (the "Company") regarding the successful placing of a fully underwritten private placement of new shares in the Company (the "Private Placement"). To arrange for settlement of the Private Placement, the Company has entered into a share lending agreement (the "Share Lending Agreement") with Saffron Hill Ventures 2 LP ("SHV") and DNB Markets, a part of DNB Bank ASA ("DNB Markets").

SHV subscribed for, and was allocated, 2,800,000 shares in the Private Placement. 

Pursuant the Share Lending Agreement and for the purposes stated above, SHV has lent out 11,200,000 shares to DNB Markets. DNB Markets will settle the share loan with new shares in the Company to be issued by the Company’s board of directors (the “Board”) pursuant to an authorization granted by the general meeting of the Company held on 16 May 2024 (the “Board Authorisation”). 

SHV is a close associate to CEO of the Company, Ranjeet Bhatia, and the share lending is therefore a notifiable transaction pursuant to Article 19 of Regulation (EU) 596/2014 on market abuse. Please see the attached forms for information regarding the share lending for more information.

During the term of the lending of said shares, SHV's shareholding in the Company will be reduced to 28,562,365 (not including the shares allocated to SHV in the Private Placement), representing approx. 29.85% of the shares and votes in the Company. Consequently, SHV's shareholding in the Company has fallen below the 1/3 threshold pursuant to Section 4-2 (1) of the Norwegian Securities Trading Act. 

Please see the attached forms for more information. 

This information is subject to disclosure requirements pursuant to Article 19 of Regulation EU 596/2014 (the EU Market Abuse Regulation) and Sections 4-2 and 5 -12 of the Norwegian Securities Trading Act.
