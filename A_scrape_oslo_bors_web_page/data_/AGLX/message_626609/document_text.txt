Reference is made to the stock exchange announcement published by Agilyx ASA (the "Company") on 22 August 2024 regarding the successful completion of a private placement of new shares raising gross proceeds of the NOK equivalent of approximately USD 40 million (the "Private Placement"). 

Reference is further made to the stock exchange announcement published by the Company on 22 August 2024 regarding the mandatory notification of trade and disclosure of large shareholding relating to the lending by Saffron Hill Ventures 2 LP ("SHV"), a company closely associated with the Company's CEO, Ranjeet Bhatia, to DNB Markets, a part of DNB Bank ASA ("DNB Markets"), acting on behalf of the managers in the Private Placement, of 11,200,000 existing and unencumbered shares in the Company that are already listed on Euronext Oslo Børs, to facilitate delivery-versus-payment settlement to investors allocated shares in the Private Placement.

Today, following registration of the share capital increase pertaining to the Company's board of directors' resolution to issue the 14,000,000 new shares in the Private Placement, DNB Markets, acting on behalf of the managers in the Private Placement, has redelivered the 11,200,000 new shares to SHV, as settlement of the borrowed shares described above. Additionally, SHV has received the 2,800,000 new shares allocated to SHV in the Private Placement.

Upon redelivery of the borrowed shares and following the share capital increase, SHV holds 42,562,365 shares in the Company, representing approximately 38.80% of the issued share capital and votes in the Company. Consequently, SHV has exceeded the 1/3 threshold pursuant to section 4-2 of the Norwegian Securities Trading Act. 

The share loan has been settled in two tranches as the total number of shares to be issued in the Private Placement will result in the Company being required to publish a listing prospectus in accordance with the requirements in the EU Prospectus Regulation: (i) tranche 1 consisted of 8,737,240 shares, equal to the number of shares that can be issued and listed without triggering the requirement of publishing a listing prospectus; and (ii) tranche 2 consisted of 5,262,760 shares ("Tranche 2"). The shares in Tranche 2 have been issued on a separate, temporary ISIN pending approval by the Norwegian Financial Supervisory Authority of a listing prospectus and will thus not be listed or tradeable on Oslo Børs until such listing prospectus has been published.
