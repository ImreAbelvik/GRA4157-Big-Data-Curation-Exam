About EMGS
EMGS, the marine EM market leader, uses its proprietary electromagnetic (EM)
technology to support oil and gas companies in their search for offshore
hydrocarbons. EMGS supports each stage in the workflow, from survey design and
data acquisition to processing and interpretation. The Company's services enable
the integration of EM data with seismic and other geophysical and geological
information to give explorationists a clearer and more complete understanding of
the subsurface. This improves exploration efficiency and reduces risks and the
finding costs per barrel. CSEM technology can also be used to detect the
presence of marine mineral deposits (primarily Seabed Massive Sulphides) and
EMGS believes that the technology can also be used to estimate the mineral
content of such deposits. The Company is undertaking early-stage initiatives to
position itself in this future market.
