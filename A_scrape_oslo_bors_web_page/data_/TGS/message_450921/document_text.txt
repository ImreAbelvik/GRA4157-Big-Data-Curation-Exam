"TGS' performance in the past two quarters, driven by strong late sales across
all regions, indicates that there has been an improvement in the underlying
fundamentals of the global market for seismic data. The combination of higher
oil price and lower cost base means that E&P companies now have more operating
cash flow that can be used for growth investments.  While we still expect some
volatility in the near-term, our counter-cyclical strategy has positioned TGS to
benefit from the improved market conditions," TGS' CEO Kristian Johansen stated.
