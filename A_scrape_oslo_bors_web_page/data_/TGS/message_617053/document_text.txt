Oslo, Norway (29 April 2024) -TGS granted the second tranche of Performance
Stock Units (PSUs) under the Magseis 2022 Long-term Incentive Plan previously
adopted and authorized by the Board of Directors of TGS ASA in 2023.

In accordance with the terms of this Plan, the second tranche of PSUs vested on
1 April 2024, resulting in a total of 61 PSU holders having the right to request
the issuance of TGS shares at par value NOK 0.05.  The company previously
determined that the final payout on the PSUs is 58.3% based on achievement of
performance metrics set forth in the plan, resulting in a total of 36,720 shares
issuable to 61 holders of the vested PSUs.

Participants had the right to request TGS to settle a portion of their vested

to the 61 employees, which amount is net of any units that were settled in
