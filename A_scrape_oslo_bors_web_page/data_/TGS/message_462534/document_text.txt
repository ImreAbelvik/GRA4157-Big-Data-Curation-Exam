"TGS has grown net revenues by 29% in the first nine months of 2018.  However,
E&P companies have for the most part maintained a cautious approach to
exploration spending and a large part of the increased revenues is related to
acreage turnover, either through M&A between E&P companies or asset swaps and
purchases.  With the market fundamentals continuing to improve, E&P companies
are likely to come under increasing pressure to replenish reserves and secure
growing production in the longer-term. Furthermore, many smaller E&P companies
which paused spending during the downcycle, will ultimately return to
exploration as they move back to a growth agenda. As a result, exploration
budgets are likely to increase from the current unsustainably low levels.

TGS is well positioned to benefit from improved market conditions going into
2019, supporting further investment growth. TGS' counter-cyclical investment
during the downturn, with high volumes of data acquired at record-low cost,
bodes well for continued industry-leading return on capital going forward," TGS'
CEO Kristian Johansen stated.
