ASKER, NORWAY (17 August 2017) - The Board of Directors of TGS-NOPEC Geophysical
Company ASA has authorized the award of PSUs (Performance Stock Units) and RSUs
(Restricted Stock Units) to be granted to 70 key employees of the Company.

The list of primary insiders receiving PSUs and RSUs is attached.  In accordance
with the measures approved by the Shareholders of TGS at the Annual General
Meeting on 9 May 2017, the PSUs and the RSUs are secured by free-standing
warrants.

Each PSU represents the right to receive the maximum of one share, while each
RSU represents the right to receive one share.

The PSUs have been granted to members of the executive team and will vest on the
third anniversary of the date of grant provided the executive remains employed
with TGS on the vesting date. Upon vesting, the PSUs will be converted to TGS
shares, depending on performance versus target metrics. The number of shares
will be determined by multiplying the number of PSUs granted by a factor of 0%
to 100%. The factor is determined by performance against three target metrics:
relative return on average capital employed compared against a defined peer
group of companies, (ii) TGS' return on average capital employed, and (iii) HSE.
Each of the performance metrics is measured for the period 1 January 2017
through 31 December 2019.

The RSUs have been granted to certain non-executive key employees and will also
vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant provided the employee remains
employed at vesting and has achieved a satisfactory performance rating against
their goals over the three year plan period. Upon vesting, the holder of the
RSUs will receive an equivalent number of TGS shares.
