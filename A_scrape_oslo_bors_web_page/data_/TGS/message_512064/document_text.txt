Oslo, Norway (25 August 2020) - Reference is made to the decision by the Annual
General Meeting of TGS-NOPEC Geophysical Company ASA ("TGS", OSE: TGS) on 12 May
2020 to decrease the share capital with NOK 481,112.50  through cancellation of
1,924,450 treasury shares held by TGS. Reference is also made to the stock
exchange announcement on 4 August 2020 published by TGS regarding vesting of
Performance Stock Units (PSUs) and Restricted Stock Units (RSUs).

The share capital decrease has now been registered with the Norwegian Register
of Business Enterprises. In addition, and as a consequence of the vesting as

The vesting of PSUs and RSUs granted by TGS in 2017 in accordance with the terms
of the 2017 Long Term Incentive Plan resulted in the right for a total of 52
participants to request the issuance of an aggregate of up to 399,500 shares of
TGS common stock pursuant to free-standing warrants subscribed by the
participant at the time of grant.  Participants had the right to request TGS to
settle a portion of the vested units in cash to allow satisfaction of employees'
tax withholding obligations arising as a result of the vest.

Following the vest of the PSUs and RSUs, an aggregate of 321,070 new shares of
TGS common stock have been issued to the 52 employees on 25 August 2020, which
amount is net of any units that were settled in cash.  The following reflects

- Tanya Herwanger - 14,130 shares
- Whitney Eaton - 1,252 shares
- Sven Borre Larsen - 20,181 shares
- Amund Soia - 1,891 shares

Attached is the list of primary insiders, reflecting the balance of TGS shares
and free-standing warrants held after the issuance of shares described above.

The share capital of TGS is thereafter NOK 29 325 849,50 consisting of
117 303 398 shares, each with a nominal value of NOK 0.25.  TGS holds 75,000 of
