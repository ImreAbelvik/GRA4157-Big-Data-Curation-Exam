Oslo, Norway (13 March 2025) - In February 2019, TGS implemented an
Employee Share Purchase Plan (ESPP) pursuant to which eligible employees can
purchase TGS common shares at a discount through payroll deductions. The ESPP
operates in six-month periods, and at the end of each period, employees in
eligible jurisdictions (United States, United Kingdom and Canada) have the
option to purchase stock at a 15% discount to the market price at the time of
purchase. The plan sets a maximum purchase of shares per employee per six-month
period and ESPP dividends are reinvested in shares.

The following primary insiders received shares from the ESPP purchase on March
7, 2025, as participants in the ESPP. The schedule attached reflects the
holdings of the primary insiders following the ESPP purchase.

---- Kristian Johansen - 100 shares

---- Tana Pool - 100 shares
