OSLO, Norway (2 March 2022) - In February 2019, TGS implemented an
Employee Share Purchase Plan (ESPP) pursuant to which eligible employees can
purchase TGS common shares at a discount through payroll deductions. The ESPP
operates in six-month periods, and at the end of each period, employees have the
option to purchase stock at a 15% discount to the market price at the time of
purchase. The plan sets a maximum purchase of 100 shares per employee per six-
month period. ESPP dividends are reinvested in shares.

On February 27, 2022, the following primary insiders received shares as
participants in the ESPP. The schedule attached reflects the holdings of the
