Units (RSUs).

As a consequence of the vesting as announced on 3 August 2021, TGS has now
issued 187,819 shares.

The vesting of PSUs and RSUs granted by TGS in 2018 in accordance with the terms

participants to request the issuance of an aggregate of up to 247,000 shares of
TGS common stock pursuant to free-standing warrants subscribed by the
participant at the time of grant.  Participants had the right to request TGS to
settle a portion of the vested units in cash to allow satisfaction of employees'
tax withholding obligations arising as a result of the vest.

Following the vest of the PSUs and RSUs, an aggregate of 187,819 new shares of
TGS common stock have been issued to the 58 employees on 6(th) October 2021,
