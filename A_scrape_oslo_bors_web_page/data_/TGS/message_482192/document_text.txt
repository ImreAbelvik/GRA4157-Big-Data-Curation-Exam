ASKER, NORWAY (5 August 2019) - In accordance with the measures approved by the
Shareholders of TGS at the Annual General Meeting on 10 May 2016, the Board of
Directors of TGS NOPEC Geophysical Company ASA authorized TGS to grant
Performance Stock Units (PSUs) and Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) under the 2016
Long Term Incentive Plan to 64 key employees of the company on 5 August 2016.
Each RSU represented the right to receive one share, while each PSU represented
the right to receive a maximum of one share depending on performance versus
target metrics measured through the period 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2018.
The granted PSUs and RSUs were secured by free-standing warrants and vested on
the third anniversary of the date of the grant.

On 5 August 2019, the PSUs and RSUs vested in accordance with the terms of the
2016 Long Term Incentive Plan, resulting in a total of 59 PSU/RSU holders having
the right to request the issuance of a total of 239,094 TGS shares at par value
NOK 0.25. The TGS Board of Directors determined that the final payout on the
PSUs is 39.375% based on achievement of performance metrics set forth in the
plan, resulting in a total of 107,494 shares issuable to nine employees for the
vested PSUs. The remaining PSUs granted will be forfeited in accordance with the
terms of the plan. In addition, 131,600 shares are issuable to 50 employees for
the vesting of the RSUs.

PSU/RSU holders have the option of allowing a portion of their vested shares to
be cash settled by TGS, using the fair market value of the shares as defined
under the plan, to cover tax withholding obligations and other necessary
deductions that arise in connection with the vest.

The following primary insiders have the right to request the issuance of the
following number of TGS shares related to the vesting of the PSUs/RSUs, a
