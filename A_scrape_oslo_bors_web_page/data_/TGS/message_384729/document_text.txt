ASKER, NORWAY (2 September 2015) - The Board of Directors of TGS-NOPEC
Geophysical Company ASA has authorized the award of PSUs (Performance Stock
Units) and RSUs (Restricted Stock Units) to be granted to 91 key employees of
the Company.
The list of primary insiders receiving PSUs and RSUs is attached.
In accordance with the measures approved by the Shareholders of TGS at the
Annual General Meeting on 6 May 2015, the PSUs and the RSUs are secured by free-
standing warrants.
Each PSU represents the right to receive the maximum of one share, while each
RSU represents the right to receive one share.
The PSUs have been granted to members of the executive team and will vest on the
third anniversary of the date of grant provided the executive remains employed
with TGS on the vesting date. Upon vesting, the PSUs will be converted to TGS
shares, depending on performance versus target metrics. The number of shares
will be determined by multiplying the number of PSUs granted by a factor of 0%
to 100%. The factor is determined by performance against three target metrics:
(i) market share of multi-client revenues within a peer group, (ii) return on
average capital employed, and (iii) HSE. Each of the performance metrics is
measured for the period1January 2015 through 31 December 2017.
The RSUs have been granted to certain non-executive key employees and will also
vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant provided the employee remains
employed at vesting. Upon vesting, the holder of the RSUs will receive an
equivalent number of TGS shares.
