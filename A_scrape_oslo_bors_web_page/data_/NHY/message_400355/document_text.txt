Although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking
statements are reasonable, these forward-looking statements are based on a
number of assumptions and forecasts that, by their nature, involve risk and
uncertainty. Various factors could cause our actual results to differ materially
from those projected in a forward-looking statement or affect the extent to
which a particular projection is realized. Factors that could cause these
differences include, but are not limited to: our continued ability to reposition
and restructure our upstream and downstream aluminium business; changes in
availability and cost of energy and raw materials; global supply and demand for
aluminium and aluminium products; world economic growth, including rates of
inflation and industrial production; changes in the relative value of currencies
and the value of commodity contracts; trends in Hydro's key markets and
competition; and legislative, regulatory and political factors.

No assurance can be given that such expectations will prove to have been
correct. Hydro disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward looking
statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
