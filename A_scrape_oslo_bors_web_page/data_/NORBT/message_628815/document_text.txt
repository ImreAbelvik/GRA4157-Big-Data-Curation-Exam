Trondheim, 1 October 2024: The Board of Directors of NORBIT ASA (the 'Company')
has decided to approve an incentive share purchase program for employees in the
NORBIT group of companies.  In total, 209 employees participated in the program.

The share purchase program is structured as a share matching program where
participants are offered the opportunity to acquire shares at market value, and
in turn, obtain a right to receive compensation in new shares equivalent to
their invested amount after 24 months if certain conditions are met.

In this year's program a total of 135,430 shares have been subscribed for. Upon
allocation, the subscription price of the shares was set to NOK 88.7128, which
corresponds to the five-day average volume weighted price of NORBIT ASA's share
prior to 23 June 2024.

resolved to increase the Company's share capital by NOK 13,543.00 through the
issuance of 135,430 new shares, each with a par value of NOK 0.10. The
resolution is based on the authorization to increase the share capital granted
by the Company's general meeting on 6 May 2024.

Following registration of the share capital increase with the Norwegian Register
