The Board of Directors of BW LPG Limited ("BW LPG" or the "Company") 
has approved a long-term management share option plan ("LTIP 2017") 
aimed to align the interests of the senior management of the Company 
with those of the shareholders.

Under LTIP 2017, members of the senior management of BW LPG will on 
an annual basis for a period of five years be awarded share options. 
The total number of options that will be awarded under LTIP 2017 
is 1,420,000 (approximately 1% of the total number of shares in 
issue), where each option will give the holder the right to acquire 
one BW LPG share from the Company. 

One-fifth of the options (i.e. 284,000 options) will be awarded 
each year in connection with the publication of the quarterly report 
for Q4 for the preceding year, except for the current year in which 
the options were awarded on 21 April 2017. The strike price for the 
options shall be equal to the sum of (i) the volume weighted average 
share price quoted on the Oslo Stock Exchange the first five trading 
days following the announcement of such quarterly report (VWAP), and 
(ii) 16% of the VWAP. The strike price for the options awarded on 21 
April 2017 is NOK 48.15.

The options will have a vesting period of three years from being 
awarded, and may then be exercised in a period of three additional 
years.

The options are non-tradable and conditional upon the option holder 
being employed by the Company or its subsidiaries and not having 
resigned or being terminated for cause prior to the vesting date. 
The following primary insiders of the Company have been awarded 
options under LTIP 2017. The total number of shares (if any) held by
