(Singapore, 28 February 2019)

The Board of Directors of BW LPG Limited (“BW LPG” or the “Company”) has approved the award of share options to the senior management of BW LPG. This is the third annual award of share options under the five-year long-term management share option plan (“LTIP 2017”) which was launched on 21 April 2017. LTIP 2017 is aimed at aligning the interests of the senior management of the Company with those of the shareholders. Details of the plan can be found in the following link: https://www.bwlpg.com/investor-centre/press-releases/detail/mgt-share-option-plan-mandatory-notification

In February 2019, the Board has expanded the “LTIP 2017” to include a broader group of the Company’s management team into the scheme and simultaneously increased the total number of options that will be awarded under LTIP 2017 to align the scheme with market terms and conditions. 

The total number of options that will be awarded under LTIP 2017 has been increased from 0.2% to 0.4% annually of the total number of shares in issue, from 284,000 to 568,000 options. The options will be awarded in connection with the publication of the Q4 report for the preceding year. 

The strike price for the options awarded shall be equal to the sum of:
(i)	the volume weighted average share price quoted on the Oslo Stock Exchange over the next five trading days following today’s release of BW LPG’s Q4 2018 report (VWAP), and 
(ii)	16% of the VWAP. 

The options will have a vesting period of three years from being awarded and may then be exercised in a period of three additional years. The options are non-tradable and conditional upon the option holder being employed by the Company or its subsidiaries and not having resigned or being terminated for cause prior to the vesting date.

The Company will purchase 568,000 common shares, representing 0.4% of the total number of shares in issue, at a price of up to US$2.5 million. The shares will be purchased from the open market, commencing on 5 March 2019 and will continue until and including 11 March 2019.
