(Singapore, 1 March 2022)

The Board of Directors of BW LPG Limited ("BW LPG", the "Company", OSE ticker code:"BWLPG.OL") has approved a new long-term management share option plan ("LTIP 2022") aimed to align the interests of senior management and key employees of the Company with those of the shareholders.

Under LTIP 2022, members of the senior management and key employees of BW LPG will, on an annual basis for a period of five years, be awarded share options. The total number of options that will be awarded under LTIP 2022 is 3,548,500 (equivalent to 2.5% of the total number of shares in issue), where each option will give the holder the right to acquire one BW LPG share from the Company.

One-fifth of the options (i.e. 709,700 options) will be awarded each year in connection with the publication of the quarterly report for Q4 of the preceding year. The strike price for the options shall be equal to the sum of (i) the volume weighted average share price quoted on the Oslo Stock Exchange the first five trading days following the announcement of such quarterly report (VWAP), and (ii) 16% of the VWAP.

The options will have a vesting period of three years from being awarded, and may then be exercised in a period of three additional years. The options are non-tradable and conditional upon the option holder being employed by the Company or its subsidiaries and not having resigned or being terminated for cause prior to the vesting date.
