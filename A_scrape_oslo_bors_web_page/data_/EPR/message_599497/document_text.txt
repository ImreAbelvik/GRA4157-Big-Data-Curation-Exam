14 September 2023: Europris ASA has carried out the long-term incentive
programme for 2023 covering restricted shares for senior executives of Europris.
The restricted shares programme provides participants the opportunity to
annually purchase shares with a three-year lock-in period for an amount limited
to a maximum of NOK 500 000. The value reduction of the shares from the lock-in
period was 14 per cent. This was calculated by an independent firm based on
Black & Scholes methodology. The market price for the shares was NOK 60.53 per
share, which corresponds to the ten-day volume-weighted average price of
Europris' share for the period 31 August to 13 September 2023. The price per
share after the value reduction (the purchase price) was NOK 52.06.
