21 May 2024: Europris ASA has carried out the long-term incentive programme for
2024 covering restricted shares. The restricted share programme provides
participants the opportunity to annually purchase shares with a three-year lock
-in period for an amount limited to a maximum of NOK 500,000. The value
reduction of the shares from the lock-in period was 14 per cent. This was
calculated by an independent firm based on Black & Scholes methodology. The
market price for the shares was NOK 69.39 per share, which corresponds to the
ten-day volume-weighted average price of Europris' share for the period 2 to 16
May 2024. The price per share after the value reduction (the purchase price) was
