14 September 2022: Europris ASA has carried out the long-term incentive
programme for 2022 covering restricted shares for senior executives and
directors of Europris. The restricted shares programme provides participants the
opportunity to annually purchase shares with a three-year lock-in period for an
amount limited to a maximum of NOK 500 000. The value reduction of the shares
from the lock-in period was 15 per cent. This was calculated by an independent
firm based on Black & Scholes methodology. The market price for the shares was
NOK 57.72 per share, which corresponds to the ten-day volume-weighted average
price of Europris' share for the period 31 August to 13 September 2022. The
price per share after the value reduction (the purchase price) was NOK 49.06.
