Hemen will, on a consolidated basis with its close associate Sterna, control 144,373,315 shares after the Private Placement and the Conversion, which is approximately 47.61% of the Company's shares and votes.

Upon delivery of the Offer Shares, Hemen will surpass the 40% threshold as per section 6-6 of the Norwegian Securities Trading Act, thereby triggering an obligation to make a bid for the remaining shares in the Company under Chapter 6 of the Norwegian Securities Trading Act. Hemen plans to make this bid within four weeks of delivery, as required by the Norwegian Securities Trading Act.
