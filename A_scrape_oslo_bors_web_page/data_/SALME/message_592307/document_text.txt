About Salmon Evolution

Salmon Evolution is a Norwegian land-based salmon farming company targeting a
production capacity of 100,000 tonnes HOG by 2032. The Company's core focus is
on extending the ocean's potential by transferring the best preconditions
offered by the sea to farm fish on land through its chosen hybrid flow-through
system technology (HFS). This secures a truly sustainable production process
with controlled and optimal growth conditions and limiting operational and
biological risk.

The Company's first production facility is strategically located at Indre Harøy
on the Norwegian west coast with unlimited access to fresh seawater, renewable
energy, established infrastructure, and an educated and experienced work force.
Phase 1 is already in operation and will have an annual capacity of 7,900 tonnes
HOG at steady state. Fully developed, the Indre Harøy facility will have an
annual capacity of 31,500 tonnes HOG.

The Company has also entered into a joint venture with Dongwon Industries where
the parties will develop, construct and operate a land-based salmon farming
facility in South Korea with an annual production capacity of 16,800 tonnes HOG,
using Salmon Evolution's chosen HFS technology.

Furthermore, Salmon Evolution has initiated a process with the aim of
establishing a land-based salmon farming operation in North America.

Salmon Evolution ASA is listed on Oslo Børs under the ticker SALME.
