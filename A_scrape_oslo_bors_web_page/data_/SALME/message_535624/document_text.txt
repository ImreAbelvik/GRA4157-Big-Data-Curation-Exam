About Salmon Evolution:

Salmon Evolution is a Norwegian land-based salmon farming company focused
on extending the ocean's potential by transferring the best preconditions
offered by the sea to farm fish on land through its hybrid flow-through system
technology (HFS). This secures a truly sustainable production process with
controlled and optimal growth conditions and limiting operational and biological
risk.

The Company's first production facility is under construction at Indre
Harøy, strategically located on the Norwegian west coast with unlimited access
to fresh seawater, renewable energy, established infrastructure for salmon
farming, and an educated and experienced work force. The entire project is
designed for an annual capacity of approx. 31,500 tonnes HOG.

The Company has also entered a joint venture with Dongwon Industries where
the parties will develop, construct and operate a land-based salmon farming
facility in South Korea with an annual production capacity of 16,800 tonnes HOG,
using Salmon Evolution's HFS technology.

Salmon Evolution ASA is listed at Euronext Growth under the ticker SALME.
