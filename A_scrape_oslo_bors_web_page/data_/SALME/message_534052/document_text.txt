About Salmon Evolution:

Salmon Evolution is a Norwegian land-based salmon farming company focused on
extending the ocean's potential by transferring the best preconditions offered
by the sea to farm fish on land through its hybrid flow-through
system technology (HFS). This secures a truly sustainable production process
with controlled and optimal growth conditions and limiting operational and
biological risk.

The Company's first production facility is under construction at Indre Harøy,
strategically located on the Norwegian west coast with unlimited access to fresh
seawater, renewable energy, established infrastructure for salmon farming, and
an educated and experienced work force. The entire project is designed for an
annual capacity of approx. 31,500 tonnes HOG.

The Company has also entered a joint venture with Dongwon Industries where the
parties will develop, construct and operate a land-based salmon farming facility
in South Korea with an annual production capacity of 16,800 tonnes HOG, using
Salmon Evolution's HFS technology.

Salmon Evolution Holding ASA is listed at Euronext Growth under the ticker
SALME.
