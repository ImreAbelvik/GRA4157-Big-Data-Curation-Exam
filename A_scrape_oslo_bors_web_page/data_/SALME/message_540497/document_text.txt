About Salmon Evolution

Salmon Evolution is a Norwegian land-based salmon farming company focused on
extending the ocean's potential by transferring the best preconditions offered
by the sea to farm fish on land through its hybrid flow-through system
technology (HFS). This secures a truly sustainable production process with
controlled and optimal growth conditions and limiting operational and biological
risk.

The company's first production facility is under construction at Indre Harøy,
strategically located on the Norwegian west coast with access to unlimited fresh
seawater, renewable energy, established infrastructure for salmon farming, and
an educated and experienced work force. The entire project is designed for an
annual capacity of approx. 31,500 tonnes HOG. In addition, the company is
expanding internationally through a JV in South Korea with Dongwon Industries
for a 16,800 tonnes HOG production facility.

Salmon Evolution ASA is listed at Oslo Stock Exchange under the ticker SALME.
