Oslo, 14 June 2023 - Panoro Energy ASA (the "Company" or "Panoro" with OSE
ticker: "PEN") announces the awards and exercise of Restricted Share Units
("RSUs") and notification of primary insider trades.

Awards of RSUs

For the year 2023, the Board of Directors have granted 719,615 RSUs to the key
employees of the Company under the Long-Term Incentive Plan ("LTIP") approved by
the shareholders at the 2021 Annual General Meeting. The awards are based on
specific performance criteria as previously approved by the Board of Directors.

One RSU will entitle the holder to receive one share in the Company against
payment in cash of the par value for the share. The par value is currently NOK
0.05 per share. Vesting of these RSUs is time based, over a period approved by
the Board of Directors. The vesting period of the RSUs is up to 14 June 2026,
where 1/3 of the RSUs vest on 14 June 2024 (the "First Tranche"), 1/3 vest after
1 year of the vesting of the First Tranche, and the final 1/3 vest after 2 years
from vesting of the First Tranche. RSUs are exercised automatically at the
respective vesting dates and the holder will be issued the applicable number of
shares as soon as possible thereafter.

Of the 719,615 RSUs, the primary insiders have been granted the following:

  · John Hamilton, the Chief Executive Officer of the Company has been granted
195,419 RSUs;
  · Qazi Qadeer, the Chief Financial Officer of the Company has been granted
96,371 RSUs;
  · Richard Morton, the Technical Director of the Company has been granted
94,181 RSUs; and
  · Nigel McKim, the Projects Director of the Company has been granted 94,181
RSUs.

The remaining 239,463 RSUs have been granted to other key employees.

Exercise of existing RSUs - settlement and Mandatory Notification of Trades

Under the Company's LTIP, 566,229 RSUs from the prior years' grants have vested
and automatically exercised. In accordance with the terms and conditions of the
RSUs, for this tranche the Board of Directors have decided to settle
approximately 55% of the exercised RSUs in new shares and the remaining 45% RSUs
in cash. A total of 309,642 new shares will be issued and 256,587 RSUs will be
settled in cash. The cash settlement for each of the exercised RSU is after
taking into account the difference between NOK 0.05 (being the face value of the
shares) and NOK 26.9470 (being the volume-weighted average price of the
Company's shares on 13 June 2023, i.e. NOK 26.8970 per share (the "Settlement
Price"). The settlement in new shares and cash have been determined after taking
into account the employees' tax liability arising on the exercise of RSUs.

Consequently, the Board has utilized its authorization and passed a resolution
to issue 309,642 new shares, each at a subscription price of NOK 0.05. Existing
shareholders' pre-emptive rights to subscribe the shares have been set aside in
order for the Company to meet its obligations under the RSU program. Following
registration of the share issue, the Company's registered share capital will be
NOK 5,847,202.40, divided into 116,944,048 shares, each having a face value of
NOK 0.05.

The total settlement of shares and cash amount is allocated as follows:
