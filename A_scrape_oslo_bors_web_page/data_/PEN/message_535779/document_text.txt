Oslo, 14 June 2021 - Panoro Energy ASA (the "Company" or "Panoro" with OSE
ticker: "PEN") announces the awards and exercise of Restricted Share Units
("RSUs") and notification of primary insider trades.

Awards of RSUs

For the year 2021, the Board of Directors have granted 528,356 RSUs to the key
employees of the Company under the Long-Term Incentive Plan ("LTIP") approved by
the shareholders at the 2021 Annual General Meeting. The awards are based on
specific performance criteria as previously approved by the Board of Directors.

One RSU will entitle the holder to receive one share in the Company against
payment in cash of the par value for the share. The par value is currently NOK
0.05 per share (the "Face Value"). Vesting of these RSUs is time based, over a
period approved by the Board of Directors. The vesting period of the RSUs is up
to 14 June 2024, where 1/3 of the RSUs vest on 14 June 2022 (the "First
Tranche"), 1/3 vest after 1 year of the vesting of the First Tranche, and the
final 1/3 vest after 2 years from vesting of the First Tranche. RSUs are
exercised automatically at the respective vesting dates and the holder will be
issued the applicable number of shares as soon as possible thereafter.

Of the 528,356 RSUs, the primary insiders have been granted the following:

  · John Hamilton, the Chief Executive Officer of the Company has been granted
166,822 RSUs;
  · Richard Morton, the Technical Director of the Company has been granted
53,599 RSUs;
  · Qazi Qadeer, the Chief Financial Officer of the Company has been granted
54,846 RSUs; and
  · Nigel McKim, the Projects Director of the Company has been granted 53,599
RSUs.

The remaining 199,490 RSUs have been granted to other key employees.

Exercise of existing RSUs - settlement and Mandatory Notification of Trades

Under the Company's LTIP, 515,072 RSUs from the prior years' grants have vested
and automatically exercised. In accordance with the terms and conditions of the
RSUs, for this tranche the Board of Directors have decided to settle
approximately 54% of the exercised RSUs in new shares and the remaining 46%
units in cash. A total of 277,402 new shares will be issued and 237,670 units
will be settled in cash. The cash settlement for each of the exercised RSU is
after taking into account the difference between the Face Value and the volume
-weighted average price as per Oslo Stock Exchange of the Company's shares on 11
June 2021 (the "Settlement Price"). The settlement in new shares and cash have
been determined after taking into account the employees' tax liability arising
on the exercise of RSUs.

Consequently, the Board has utilized its authorization and passed a resolution
to issue 277,402 new shares, each at a subscription price of NOK 0.05. Existing
shareholders' pre-emptive rights to subscribe the shares have been set aside in
order for the Company to meet its obligations under the RSU program. Following
registration of the share issue, the Company's registered share capital will be
NOK 5,664,684.50, divided into 113,293,690 shares, each having a face value of
NOK 0.05.

The total settlement of shares and cash amount is allocated as follows:

  · John Hamilton, Chief Executive Officer has exercised 239,314 RSUs and will
receive 126,837 new shares and 112,477 units in cash settlement at Settlement
Price. Following this, Mr. Hamilton controls 520,020 shares in the Company's
enhanced share capital and holds 448,821 RSUs.
  · Richard Morton, Technical Director has exercised 76,844 RSUs and will
