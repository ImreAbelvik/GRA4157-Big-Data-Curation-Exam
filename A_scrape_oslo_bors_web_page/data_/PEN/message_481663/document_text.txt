Oslo, 19 July 2019 - Panoro Energy ASA (the "Company" or "Panoro" with OSE
ticker: "PEN") announces the awards and exercise of Restricted Share Units
("RSUs") and notification of primary insider trades.

Awards of RSUs

For the year 2019, the Board of Directors have granted 473,696 RSUs to the key
employees of the Company under the Long-Term Incentive Plan ("LTIP") approved by
the shareholders at the 2018 Annual General Meeting. The awards are based on
specific performance criteria as previously approved by the Board of Directors.

One RSU will entitle the holder to receive one share in the Company against
payment in cash of the par value for the share. The par value is currently NOK
0.05 per share. Vesting of these RSUs is time based, over a period approved by
the Board of Directors. The vesting period of the RSUs is up to 14 June 2022,
where 1/3 of the RSUs vest on 14 June 2020 (the "First Tranche"), 1/3 vest after
1 year of the vesting of the First Tranche, and the final 1/3 vest after 2 years
from vesting of the First Tranche. RSUs are exercised automatically at the
respective vesting dates and the holder will be issued the applicable number of
shares as soon as possible thereafter.

Of the 473,696 RSUs, the primary insiders have been granted the following:

  ·  John Hamilton, the Chief Executive Officer of the Company has been granted
197,280 RSUs;
  ·  Richard Morton, the Technical Director of the Company has been granted
63,315 RSUs;
  ·  Qazi Qadeer, the Chief Financial Officer of the Company has been granted
63,315 RSUs; and
  ·  Nigel McKim, the Projects Director of the Company has been granted 61,450
RSUs.

The remaining 88,336 RSUs have been granted to other key employees.

Exercise of existing RSUs - settlement and Mandatory Notification of Trades

Under the Company's LTIP, 327,352 RSUs from the prior years' grants have vested
and have been automatically exercised. In accordance with the terms and
conditions of the RSUs, for this tranche the Board of Directors have decided to
settle 53% of the exercised RSUs in new shares. A total of 173,498 new shares
will be issued as part of the exercise of the 327,352 RSUs. The cash settlement
for each of the exercised RSU is after taking into account the difference
between NOK 0.05 (being the face value of the shares) and NOK 16.2325 (being the
volume-weighted average price of the Company's shares on 18 July 2019, i.e. NOK
16.1825 per share. The settlement in new shares and cash have been determined
after taking into account the employees' tax liability arising on the exercise
of RSUs.

Consequently, the Board has utilized its authorization to issue new shares and
passed a resolution to issue 173,498 new shares, each at a subscription price of
NOK 0.05. Existing shareholders' pre-emptive rights to subscribe the shares have
been set aside in order for the Company to meet its obligations under the RSU
program. Following registration of the share issue, the Company's registered
share capital will be NOK 3,128,054.90, divided into 62,561,098 shares, each
having a face value of NOK 0.05.
