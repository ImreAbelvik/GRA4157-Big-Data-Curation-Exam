Oslo, 14 June 2022 - Panoro Energy ASA (the "Company" or "Panoro" with OSE
ticker: "PEN") announces the awards and exercise of Restricted Share Units
("RSUs") and notification of primary insider trades.

Awards of RSUs

For the year 2022, the Board of Directors have granted 487,434 RSUs to the key
employees of the Company under the Long-Term Incentive Plan ("LTIP") approved by
the shareholders at the 2021 Annual General Meeting. The awards are based on
specific performance criteria as previously approved by the Board of Directors.

One RSU will entitle the holder to receive one share in the Company against
payment in cash of the par value for the share. The par value is currently NOK
0.05 per share. Vesting of these RSUs is time based, over a period approved by
the Board of Directors. The vesting period of the RSUs is up to 14 June 2025,
where 1/3 of the RSUs vest on 14 June 2023 (the "First Tranche"), 1/3 vest after
1 year of the vesting of the First Tranche, and the final 1/3 vest after 2 years
from vesting of the First Tranche. RSUs are exercised automatically at the
respective vesting dates and the holder will be issued the applicable number of
shares as soon as possible thereafter.

Of the 487,434 RSUs, the primary insiders have been granted the following:

  · John Hamilton, the Chief Executive Officer of the Company has been granted
131,772 RSUs;
  · Richard Morton, the Technical Director of the Company has been granted
63,507 RSUs;

64,983 RSUs; and

Exercise of existing RSUs - settlement and Mandatory Notification of Trades

Under the Company's LTIP, 570,501 RSUs from the prior years' grants have vested
and automatically exercised. In accordance with the terms and conditions of the
RSUs, for this tranche the Board of Directors have decided to settle
approximately 54% of the exercised RSUs in new shares and the remaining 46% RSUs
in cash. A total of 305,682 new shares will be issued and 264,819 RSUs will be
settled in cash. The cash settlement for each of the exercised RSU is after
taking into account the difference between NOK 0.05 (being the face value of the
shares) and NOK 33.0371 (being the volume-weighted average price of the
Company's shares on 13 June 2022, i.e. NOK 32.9871 per share (the "Settlement
Price"). The settlement in new shares and cash have been determined after taking
into account the employees' tax liability arising on the exercise of RSUs.

Consequently, the Board has utilized its authorization and passed a resolution
to issue 305,682 new shares, each at a subscription price of NOK 0.05. Existing
shareholders' pre-emptive rights to subscribe the shares have been set aside in
order for the Company to meet its obligations under the RSU program. Following
registration of the share issue, the Company's registered share capital will be
NOK 5,684,468.6, divided into 113,689,372 shares, each having a face value of
NOK 0.05.
