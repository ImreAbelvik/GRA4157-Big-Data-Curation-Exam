Oslo, 16 June 2025 - Panoro Energy ASA (the "Company" or "Panoro" with OSE
ticker: "PEN") announces the awards and exercise of Restricted Share Units
("RSUs") and notification of primary insider trades.

Awards of RSUs

For the year 2025, the Board of Directors have awarded 771,579 RSUs to the key
employees of the Company under the Long-Term Incentive Plan ("LTIP") approved by
the shareholders at the 2024 Annual General Meeting. The awards are based on
specific performance criteria as previously approved by the Board of Directors.

One RSU will entitle the holder to receive one share in the Company against
payment in cash of the par value for the share. The par value is currently NOK
0.05 per share. Vesting of these RSUs is time based, over a period approved by
the Board of Directors. The vesting period of the RSUs is up to 14 June 2028,
where 1/3 of the RSUs vest on 14 June 2026 (the "First Tranche"), 1/3 vest after
1 year of the vesting of the First Tranche, and the final 1/3 vest after 2 years
from vesting of the First Tranche. RSUs are exercised automatically at the
respective vesting dates and the holder will be issued the applicable number of
shares as soon as possible thereafter.

Of the 771,579 RSUs, the primary insiders have been awarded the following:

  · John Hamilton, the Chief Executive Officer of the Company has been awarded
242,337 RSUs;
  · Qazi Qadeer, the Chief Financial Officer of the Company has been awarded
121,830 RSUs;
  · Richard Morton, the Technical Director of the Company has been awarded
108,708 RSUs; and
  · The remaining 298,704 RSUs have been awarded to other key employees.

Exercise of existing RSUs - settlement and Mandatory Notification of Trades

Under the Company's LTIP, 581,660 RSUs from the prior years' awards have vested
and automatically exercised. In accordance with the terms and conditions of the
RSUs, for this tranche the Board of Directors have decided to settle
approximately 53% of the exercised RSUs in shares and the remaining 47% RSUs in
cash. A total of 309,870 shares will be transferred to employees from the
treasury shares acquired by the Company under its share buy-back programme and
271,790 RSUs will be settled in cash. The settlement for each of the exercised
RSU is after taking into account the difference between NOK 0.05 (being the face
value of the shares) and NOK 26.1149 (being the volume-weighted average price of
the Company's shares on 13 June 2025, i.e. NOK 26.0649 per share (the
"Settlement Price"). The proportion of settlement in shares and cash has been
determined after taking into account the employees' tax liability arising on the
exercise of RSUs.

Following the transfer of shares to settle this year's RSU obligation, the
Company's registered share capital has remained unchanged at NOK 5,672,202.40,
divided into 113,444,048 shares, each having a face value of NOK 0.05.

The total settlement of shares and cash amount is allocated as follows:

  · John Hamilton, Chief Executive Officer has exercised 172,269 RSUs and will
receive 91,303 shares and 80,966 units in cash settlement at Settlement Price.
