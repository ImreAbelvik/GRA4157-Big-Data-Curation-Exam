Oslo, 24 June 2020 - Panoro Energy ASA (the "Company" or "Panoro" with OSE
ticker: "PEN") announces the awards and exercise of Restricted Share Units
("RSUs") and notification of primary insider trades.

Awards of RSUs

For the year 2020, the Board of Directors have granted 719,087 RSUs to the key
employees of the Company under the Long-Term Incentive Plan ("LTIP") approved by
the shareholders at the 2018 Annual General Meeting. The awards are based on
specific performance criteria as previously approved by the Board of Directors.

One RSU will entitle the holder to receive one share in the Company against
payment in cash of the par value for the share. The par value is currently NOK
0.05 per share. Vesting of these RSUs is time based, over a period approved by
the Board of Directors. The vesting period of the RSUs is up to 14 June 2023,
where 1/3 of the RSUs vest on 14 June 2021 (the "First Tranche"), 1/3 vest after
1 year of the vesting of the First Tranche, and the final 1/3 vest after 2 years
from vesting of the First Tranche. RSUs are exercised automatically at the
respective vesting dates and the holder will be issued the applicable number of
shares as soon as possible thereafter.

Of the 719,087 RSUs, the primary insiders have been granted the following:

  · John Hamilton, the Chief Executive Officer of the Company has been granted
324,358 RSUs;
  · Richard Morton, the Technical Director of the Company has been granted

Exercise of existing RSUs - settlement and Mandatory Notification of Trades

Under the Company's LTIP, 415,372 RSUs from the prior years' grants have vested
and have been automatically exercised. In accordance with the terms and
conditions of the RSUs, for this tranche the Board of Directors have decided to
settle approximately 54% of the exercised RSUs in new shares. A total of 222,401
new shares will be issued as part of the exercise of the 415,372 RSUs. The cash
settlement for each of the exercised RSU is after taking into account the
difference between NOK 0.05 (being the face value of the shares) and NOK 11.3979
(being the volume-weighted average price of the Company's shares on 23 June
2020, i.e. NOK 11.3479 per share. The settlement in new shares and cash have
been determined after taking into account the employees' tax liability arising
on the exercise of RSUs.

Consequently, the Board has utilized its authorization and passed a resolution
to issue 222,401 new shares, each at a subscription price of NOK 0.05. Existing
shareholders' pre-emptive rights to subscribe the shares have been set aside in
order for the Company to meet its obligations under the RSU program. Following
registration of the share issue, the Company's registered share capital will be
NOK 3,451,099.30, divided into 69,021,986 shares, each having a face value of
