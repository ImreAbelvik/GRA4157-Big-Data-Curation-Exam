Attached is a PDMR notification for Mr. Henrik Brill Jensen, COO of Napatech A/S. The form reports the divestiture of 133,284 Napatech shares. The transaction occurred as an inadvertent result of a change of Napatech's pension scheme supplier. 

With effect from October 2023, Napatech changed its pension scheme supplier for all employees. In connection with the transfer of the existing pension scheme to the Company's new supplier, the aforementioned Napatech shares, which were held under the previous pension scheme, were sold. The sale occurred without Mr. Jensen's instructions or knowledge. As the sale occurred inadvertently, Mr Brill intends to use the proceeds from the transaction to re-acquire the NAPA shares in the near future. Mr. Jensen's 253,871 Napatech shares held outside the pension scheme were not affected by the incident and remain owned by Mr. Jensen.
