COPENHAGEN, Denmark, November 6, 2024 – Napatech (OSLO: NAPA.OL) 

Napatech (the "Company") hereby reports that the Company, as part of a process of strengthening the internal rules and procedures related to share trading and handling of inside information, has decided to adjust the group of persons deemed a "person discharging managerial responsibilities" ("PDMR") pursuant to Article 19(5) of the market abuse regulation. The adjustment has been decided to ensure better alignment between the legal definition of a PDMR and the group of persons classified as such by the Company. Accordingly, the current positions of Chief Marketing Officer and Chief Research & Development Officer are no longer deemed a PDMR in relation to the market abuse regulation.

Consequently, for the purpose of complying with the PDMR rules, the updated list of PDMRs pursuant to Article 19(5) of the market abuse regulation contains the members of the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer, and the natural and legal persons closely associated hereto.
