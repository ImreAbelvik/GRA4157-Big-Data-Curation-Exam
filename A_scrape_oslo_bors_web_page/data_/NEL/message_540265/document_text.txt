(Oslo, 19 August 2021) Nel ASA has today resolved to grant options to all
employees of the company that fulfil the requirements for participation in the
employee share option plan. The grant of options is based on the authorization
from Nel's annual general meeting (AGM) of 15 April 2021 to issue new shares in
connection with Nel's incentive plan for employees, and the same AGM's adoption
of the statement of the board regarding long-term incentive plans

A total number of 7,768,464 share options were granted in a groupwide program
comprising all employees in Nel fulfilling certain criteria. Each option, when
exercised, will give the right to acquire one share in the Company. The options
are granted without consideration. Pursuant to the vesting schedule, 40% of the
options will vest two years after the day of grant, and 60% of the options will
vest three years after the day of grant. Vesting requires the option holder
still to be an employee in the Company. The strike price of the options shall be
NOK 15.125 based on the higher of the average price of the Nel ASA share the
last five trading days and the closing price of the Nel ASA share on the grant
date and including an 8% premium. The options that have not been exercised will
lapse 4 years after the date of grant. The gain per instrument is capped at NOK
10 maximum per share option.
