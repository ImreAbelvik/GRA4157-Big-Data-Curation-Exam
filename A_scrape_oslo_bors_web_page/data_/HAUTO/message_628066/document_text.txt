As part of an internal reorganisation, certain transactions have been initiated by closely associated entities of Leif O. Høegh and Morten W. Høegh, both primary insiders in Höegh Autoliners ASA (the "Company"). None of the transactions will result in any change of control or alteration in the beneficial ownership of shares in the Company.

In summary, Leif Höegh & Co AS, the largest shareholder in the Company, became a subsidiary of Aequitas Shipping AS on 18 September 2024 through the transfer of shares from Gadus SE and Pomor Shipping Norway AS, each previously holding 50% of the shares in Leif Höegh & Co AS. Aequitas Shipping AS is a subsidiary of Aequitas Ltd. Subsequent to this transfer, Gadus SE and Pomor Shipping Norway AS subscribed for a share capital increase in Aequitas Ltd, conducted as a private placement. In addition, Pomor Shipping Norway AS will be liquidated and all of its assets, including its shares in Aequitas Ltd, shall be transferred to its sole parent company Pomor Shipping Ltd. 

The Oslo Stock Exchange, in its capacity as takeover supervisory authority, has in a decision dated 12 July 2024 resolved to grant an exemption from the mandatory bid obligation pursuant to section 6-2 (3) of the Norwegian Securities Trading Act with respect to the transactions.
