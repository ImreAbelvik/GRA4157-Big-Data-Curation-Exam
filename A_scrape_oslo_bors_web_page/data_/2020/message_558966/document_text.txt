In January 2019, the Board of Directors established a long-term incentive plan
and approved a grant of 740,000 share options to employees and directors (the
"LTI Plan").

The Board has resolved to grant 60,000 share options to employees including one
person discharging managerial responsibilities ("PDMR") as defined by the Market
Abuse Regulation pursuant to the Company's LTI Plan. Each share option gives the
holder the right to purchase one share in the Company at an exercise price of
US$18 per share. The share options will vest equally over a three year period,
commencing one year from date of grant and will expire five years after the
grant date.

The following PDMR has been granted share options:

Herman Billung (CEO of 2020 Bulkers Management AS), was granted 50,000 share
options, following which he holds 10,000 shares and 50,000 share options.

Following the grant, the total number of outstanding share options is 730,000.
