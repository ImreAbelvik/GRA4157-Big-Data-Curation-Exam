Reference is made to the stock exchange announcement published by Lerøy Seafood
Group ASA ("Lerøy") on 16 September 2016 regarding the Mandatory Offer made by
Lerøy to acquire all outstanding Shares in Havfisk ASA ("HAVFISK") not already
owned by Lerøy for an offer price of NOK 36.50 per Share, and the voluntary
offer to acquire all outstanding shares in Norway Seafoods Group AS ("NWSF") for
an offer price of NOK 1.00 per share. Terms used in this announcement shall have
the same meaning as ascribed to them in the Offer Document dated 16 September
2016.

The Offer Period expired at 18:00 CET on 17 October 2016.

In total, Lerøy has registered acceptances for 23,350,627 Shares in HAVFISK,
which constitutes 27.59 per cent of the Shares and voting rights in HAVFISK.
Including the 57,692,157 Shares already held by Lerøy, this will aggregate to
81,042,784 Shares in HAVFISK, representing 95.74 per cent of the Shares and the
votes in HAVFISK. The calculation of the number of HAVFISK Shares for which
acceptances have been received in the Offer is preliminary as the registration
of acceptances with the VPS for practical reasons has not yet been completed,
and remains subject to potential adjustments. The final result of the Offer will
be announced once confirmed by the Financial Advisors. Settlement of the Offer
will be made as soon as reasonably possible, and no later than 31 October 2016.

Upon settlement of the Offer, Lerøy will hold more than 90 per cent of all
HAVFISK Shares, and will therefore have the right (and each remaining
Shareholder in HAVFISK will have the right to require Lerøy) to initiate a
Compulsory Acquisition of the remaining HAVFISK Shares pursuant to section 4-25
of the Norwegian Public Limited Companies Act. As indicated in section 1.20 of
the Offer Document, Lerøy reconfirms with this announcement that it still
intends to proceed with a Compulsory Acquisition of the remaining HAVFISK Shares
at a price equal to the Offer Price of NOK 36.50 per Share.

Lerøy is represented on the Board of Directors of HAVFISK. Lerøy does not own
any other rights to acquire shares in HAVFISK.

In addition, Lerøy has registered acceptances for 5,942,415 shares in NWSF,
which constitutes 7.01 per cent of the total shares in NWSF. Including the
62,293,254 shares already held by Lerøy, this will aggregate to 68,235,669
shares in NWSF, representing 80.50 per cent of the total shares in NWSF.

This information is subject to the disclosure requirements pursuant to sections
4-2, 4-3 and 6-18 of the Norwegian Securities Trading Act.
