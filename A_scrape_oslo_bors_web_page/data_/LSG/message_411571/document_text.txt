Reference is made to the stock exchange announcement published by Lerøy Seafood
Group ASA ("Lerøy") on 16 September 2016 regarding the Mandatory Offer made by
Lerøy to acquire all outstanding Shares in Havfisk ASA ("HAVFISK") not already
owned by Lerøy for an offer price of NOK 36.50 per Share. Terms used in this
announcement shall have the same meaning as ascribed to them in the Offer
Document dated 16 September 2016.

The Offer Period expired at 18:00 CET on 17 October 2016.

In total, Lerøy has registered acceptances for 23,503,906 Shares in HAVFISK,
which constitutes 27.77 per cent of the Shares and voting rights in HAVFISK.
Including the 57,692,157 Shares already held by Lerøy, this will aggregate to
81,196,063 Shares in HAVFISK, representing 95.92 per cent of the Shares and the
votes in HAVFISK. Settlement of the Offer will be made on or about 21 October
2016.

Upon settlement of the Offer, Lerøy will hold more than 90 per cent of all
HAVFISK Shares, and will therefore have the right (and each remaining
Shareholder in HAVFISK will have the right to require Lerøy) to initiate a
Compulsory Acquisition of the remaining HAVFISK Shares pursuant to section 4-25
of the Norwegian Public Limited Companies Act. As indicated in section 1.20 of
the Offer Document, Lerøy reconfirms with this announcement that it still
intends to proceed with a Compulsory Acquisition of the remaining HAVFISK Shares
at a price equal to the Offer Price of NOK 36.50 per Share.

Lerøy is represented on the Board of Directors of HAVFISK. Lerøy does not own
any other rights to acquire shares in HAVFISK.

Receiving Agents in connection with the mandatory offer on Havfisk ASA.
