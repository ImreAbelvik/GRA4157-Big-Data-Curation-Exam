Primary insiders have exercised synthetic share options in Grieg Seafood ASA as
outlined in the enclosed list.

The settlement amount (the difference between the exercise price and the
adjusted share price) is paid in cash. Each beneficiary of the synthetic share
option program is obliged to re-invest 50% of the settlement amount after taxes
for the acquisition of shares in Grieg Seafood ASA within the next three months.
However, this obligation to re-invest at least 50% of the settlement amount
applies up to the point where the option holder holds shares in Grieg Seafood
ASA (calculated at the highest of the original acquisition price and the market
price at the exercise date) equal to 100% of the option holder's current annual
gross salary.
