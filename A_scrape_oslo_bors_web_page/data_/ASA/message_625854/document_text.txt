About Atlantic Sapphire ASA:
Atlantic Sapphire is pioneering Bluehouse® (land-raised) salmon farming, locally, and transforming protein production, globally.

In the US, the Company holds the requisite permits and patents to construct its Bluehouse® in an ideal location in Homestead, Florida, just south of Miami. The Company's Phase 1 facility is in operation, which provides the capacity to harvest up to approximately 9,500 tons (HOG) of salmon annually. The Company completed its first commercial harvest in the US in September 2020.
