About Atlantic Sapphire ASA 
Atlantic Sapphire is pioneering Bluehouse® (land-raised) salmon farming, locally, and transforming protein production, globally. Atlantic Sapphire operated its innovation center in Denmark from 2011 until 2021 with a strong focus on R&D and innovation to equip the Company with the technology and procedures that enable the Company to commercially scale up production in end markets close to the consumer. 

In the US, the Company holds the requisite permits and patents to construct its Bluehouse® in an ideal location in Homestead, Florida, just south of Miami. The Company's Phase 1 facility is in operation, which provides the capacity to harvest approximately 10,000 tons (HOG) of salmon annually. The Company completed its first commercial harvest in the US in September 2020. Atlantic Sapphire is currently constructing its Phase 2 expansion, which will bring total annual production capacity to 25,000 tons, and has a long-term targeted harvest volume of 220,000 tons.
