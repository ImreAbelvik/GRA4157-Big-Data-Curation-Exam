insiders

On the basis of the approval by the General Meeting on 28 April 2022 to
authorize the Board of Directors of StrongPoint ASA (the 'Company', OSE ticker
"STRO") to issue shares to employees under a long-term incentive program, the
Board of Directors has resolved to issue share options to key employees in the
Company.

A total of 50,000 options for shares in the Company have been distributed
amongst the employees. The number of options granted corresponds to 0.1% of the
outstanding number of shares in the Company. Each option gives the right to
acquire one share in the Company. The options are granted without consideration.
Pursuant to the vesting schedule, 25% of the options will vest one year after
the day of grant, 25% of the options will vest two years after the day of grant
and the remaining 50% will vest three years after the day of grant (vesting is
dependent on the option holder still being employed in the Company). The
exercise price for all options granted is NOK 20.53 per share. Options that are
not exercised within 5 years from the date of grant will lapse and become void.

This information is subject to disclosure requirements set out in the Market
Abuse Regulation EU 596/2014 Article 19 and the Norwegian Securities Trading Act
Section 5-12.
