Bergen, Norway, 8 December 2023 - BerGenBio ASA (the "Company") (OSE:BGBIO), a
clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel, selective AXL kinase
inhibitors for severe unmet medical needs, today announce that the Board of
Directors has granted options to employees.

The annual general meeting in the Company on 22 May 2023 approved the share
option program and authorised the board of directors of the Company to issue up
to 129,090,000 share options to the Company's employees as part of a long-term
incentive plan.

Options granted under the share option program will normally vest equally over a
three-year period from the date of grant and each option, when exercised, will
give the right to receive one share in the Company at a fixed strike price set
at time of grant. Options granted under the share option program expire eight
years after grant date.

A total of 112,000,000 share options were granted, equal to 4.2% of total issued
shares in the Company and 2.8% on a fully dilutive basis including all
outstanding Warrants and options. The strike price for this grant is NOK 0.2113
per option equal to the volume weighted average share price the last 14 days
before the grant.

The board considers an option program as an important element in attracting and
retaining employees to foster long-term success. The board considers the option
program terms and allocation to be at the market for comparable peers.

After this grant total issued options equals 4.3% of the total issued shares in
the Company and 2.9% on a fully dilutive basis compared to the average level
over the last five years of 5.5% of issued shares in the Company and 5.0% on a
fully dilutive basis.
