NBX has issued the first put option notice pertaining to the earlier announced put option agreement with LDA Capital Ltd. ("LDA"). Until new shares are issued, and as part of the put option agreement, three major shareholders have agreed to lend to LDA the necessary shares for each put option notice.

For this put option notice, 750,000 shares were lent to LDA by SAM Eiendomspartner AS on 4. April. SAM Eiendomspartner AS is a wholly owned company of Stig Aleksander Kjos-Mathisen, CEO and primary insider in Norwegian Block Exchange AS.

Within twelve (12) months NBX will issue to LDA the number of ordinary shares subscribed for in this put option notice for LDA to return to the share lenders.

This information is subject to the disclosure requirements in article 19 of Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 (the EU Market Abuse Regulation).
