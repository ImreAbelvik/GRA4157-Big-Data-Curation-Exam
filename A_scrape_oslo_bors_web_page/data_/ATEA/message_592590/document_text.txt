Atea ASA has established an Employee Share Savings Program (the "Program"),
which is open to all employees of the Atea Group. The purpose of the program is
to engage employees and foster a culture of employee ownership in the Company.

Under the terms of the Program, participating employees may allocate a fixed
amount of their monthly after-tax salary to purchase shares in Atea ASA (up to a
maximum per month is NOK 1,000 in Norway, SEK 1,000 in Sweden, DKK 700 in
Denmark and EUR 100 per month in Finland and the Baltic countries). Shares are
purchased by employees from Atea ASA's treasury share holdings at market price.
The price of the shares purchased is determined based on the volume-weighted
average price of the ATEA share on the day preceding the share transfer.

As an additional incentive, participating employees will receive one "bonus"
share for each two ordinary shares purchased under the Program after a vesting
period in which the specified ordinary shares must be held. The vesting period
is three years for executive management and two years for all other employees.
The participant must also remain employed by Atea during the vesting period in
order to receive the bonus share.  The "bonus" share is treated as a restricted
stock unit (RSU) under IFRS 2 Share-Based Compensation.

2,812 Atea employees have registered to participate in the program, representing
approximately 35% of total employees. Employees may register into or out of the
program four times per year.

On June 5, employees in the Atea Group purchased 35,374 shares under the
Employee Share Savings Program.  Shares were purchased from Atea's treasury
share holdings at a share price of NOK 153.17 per share, corresponding to the
volume-weighted average share price on 5 June 2023. The cost of the shares will
be deducted from the employees' after-tax salary in June and July 2023. After
the transaction, Atea ASA holds 1,442,368 of its own shares in treasury.
