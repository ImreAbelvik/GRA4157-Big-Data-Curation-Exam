Reference is made to the stock exchange notice dated June 6, 2023 regarding the
launch and terms of the Atea Employee Share Savings Program (the "Program"). The
purpose of the Program is to engage employees and foster a culture of employee
ownership in the Company.

Under the terms of the Program, participating employees may allocate a fixed
amount of their monthly after-tax salary to purchase shares in Atea ASA (up to a
maximum per month is NOK 1,000 in Norway, SEK 1,000 in Sweden, DKK 700 in
Denmark and EUR 100 per month in Finland and the Baltic countries). Shares are
purchased by employees from Atea ASA's treasury share holdings at market price.
The price of the shares purchased is determined based on the volume-weighted
average price of the ATEA share on the day preceding the share transfer.

As an additional incentive, participating employees will receive one "bonus"
share for each two ordinary shares purchased under the Program after a vesting
period in which the specified ordinary shares must be held. The vesting period
is three years for executive management and two years for all other employees.
The participant must also remain employed by Atea during the vesting period in
order to receive the bonus share.  The "bonus" share is treated as a restricted
stock unit (RSU) under IFRS 2 Share-Based Payment.

3,106 Atea employees are presently registered in the Program, representing
approximately 38% of all employees in the Atea Group.

On February 12, these employees purchased 68,318 shares in Atea ASA.  Shares
were purchased from Atea's treasury share holdings at a share price of NOK
128.26 per share, corresponding to the volume-weighted average share price on
February 9, 2024. The cost of the shares will be deducted from the employees'
after-tax salary in February, March and April. After the transaction, Atea ASA
holds 912,402 of its own shares.
