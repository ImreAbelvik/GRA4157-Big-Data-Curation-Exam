Reference is made to the stock exchange notice dated June 6, 2023 regarding the
launch and terms of the Atea Employee Share Savings Program (the "Program"). The
purpose of the Program is to engage employees and foster a culture of employee
ownership in the Company.

Under the terms of the Program, participating employees may allocate a fixed
amount of their monthly after-tax salary to purchase shares in Atea ASA (up to a
maximum per month is NOK 1,000 in Norway, SEK 1,000 in Sweden, DKK 700 in
Denmark and EUR 100 per month in Finland and the Baltic countries). Shares are
purchased by employees from Atea ASA's treasury share holdings at market price.
The price of the shares purchased is determined based on the volume-weighted
average price of the ATEA share on the day preceding the share transfer.

As an additional incentive, participating employees will receive one "bonus"
share for each two ordinary shares purchased under the Program after a vesting
period in which the specified ordinary shares must be held. The vesting period
is three years for executive management and two years for all other employees.
The participant must also remain employed by Atea during the vesting period in
order to receive the bonus share.  The "bonus" share is treated as a restricted
stock unit (RSU) under IFRS 2 Share-Based Payment.

3,061 Atea employees are presently registered in the Program, representing
approximately 37% of all employees in the Atea Group.

On August 8, these employees purchased 62,974 shares in Atea ASA.  Shares were
purchased from Atea's treasury share holdings at a share price of NOK 133.49 per
share, corresponding to the volume-weighted average share price on August 7,
2023. The cost of the shares will be deducted from the employees' after-tax
salary in August, September and October 2023. After the transaction, Atea ASA
holds 1,335,101 of its own shares.
