persons"). Any investment activity to which this communication relates will only
be available to and will only be engaged with, relevant persons. Any person who
is not a relevant person should not act or rely on this document or any of its
contents.

This communication is distributed in any member state of the European Economic
Area which applies Directive 2003/71/EC (this Directive together with any
implementing measures in any member state, the "Prospectus Directive") only to
those persons who are qualified investors for the purposes of the Prospectus
Directive in such member state, and such other persons as this document may be
addressed on legal grounds, and no person that is not a relevant person or
qualified investor may act or rely on this document or any of its contents.

This announcement does not constitute a prospectus and nothing herein contains
an offering of securities. No one should purchase or subscribe for any
securities in the Company, except on the basis of information in any prospectus
published by the Company in connection with the potential offering and admission
of such securities to trading and official listing on Oslo Børs. Copies of any
such offering memorandum will, following publication, be available from the
Company's registered office.

The Managers and their affiliates are acting exclusively for the Company and no
-one else in connection with the intended offering. They will not regard any
other person as their respective clients in relation to the intended offering
and will not be responsible to anyone other than the Company for providing the
protections afforded to their respective clients, nor for providing advice in
relation to the intended offering, the contents of this announcement or any
transaction, arrangement or other matter referred to herein.

In connection with the contemplated offering, the Managers and any of their
affiliates, acting as investors for their own accounts, may subscribe for or
purchase shares and in that capacity may retain, purchase, sell, offer to sell
or otherwise deal for their own accounts in such shares and other securities of
the Company or related investments in connection with the contemplated offering
or otherwise. Accordingly, references in the prospectus, if published, to the
shares being issued, offered, subscribed, acquired, placed or otherwise dealt in
should be read as including any issue or offer to, or subscription, acquisition,
placing or dealing by, such Managers and any of their affiliates acting as
investors for their own accounts. The Managers do not intend to disclose the
extent of any such investment or transactions otherwise than in accordance with
any legal or regulatory obligations to do so.

Solely for the purposes of the product governance requirements contained within:
(a) EU Directive 2014/65/EU on markets in financial instruments, as amended
("MiFID II"); (b) Articles 9 and 10 of Commission Delegated Directive (EU)
2017/593 supplementing MiFID II; and (c) local implementing measures (together,
the "MiFID II Product Governance Requirements"), and disclaiming all and any
liability, which any "manufacturer" (for the purposes of the MiFID II Product
Governance Requirements) may otherwise have with respect thereto, the Shares
have been subject to a product approval process, which has determined that they
each are: (i) compatible with an end target market of retail investors and
investors who meet the criteria of professional clients and eligible
counterparties, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) eligible for distribution
through all distribution channels as are permitted by MiFID II (the "Target
Market Assessment"). Notwithstanding the Target Market Assessment, distributors
should note that: the price of the Shares may decline and investors could lose
all or part of their investment; the Shares offer no guaranteed income and no
capital protection; and an investment in the Shares is compatible only with
investors who do not need a guaranteed income or capital protection, who (either
alone or in conjunction with an appropriate financial or other adviser) are
capable of evaluating the merits and risks of such an investment and who have
sufficient resources to be able to bear any losses that may result therefrom.
Conversely, an investment in the Shares is not compatible with investors looking
for full capital protection or full repayment of the amount invested or having
no risk tolerance, or investors requiring a fully guaranteed income or fully
predictable return profile.

The Target Market Assessment is without prejudice to the requirements of any
contractual, legal or regulatory selling restrictions in relation to the
Offering.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Target Market Assessment does not constitute:
(a) an assessment of suitability or appropriateness for the purposes of MiFID
II; or (b) a recommendation to any investor or group of investors to invest in,
or purchase, or take any other action whatsoever with respect to the Shares.

Each distributor is responsible for undertaking its own Target Market Assessment
in respect of the Shares and determining appropriate distribution channels.
