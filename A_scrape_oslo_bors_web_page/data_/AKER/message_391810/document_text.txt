Reference is made to Aker ASA's stock exchange release dated 17 December 2015
concerning an offer to buy back shares in connection with Aker ASA's employee
share purchase programme, as well as for other corporate purposes (the "Offer").
The Offer expired on 17 December 2015 at 16:30 (CET).

Aker ASA has resolved to buy back 150 000 shares, as set out in the Offer, at a
price of NOK 162 per share. The price was determined through a bookbuilding
process. The total number of acceptances exceeded the amount of shares to be
bought back under the Offer, and thus, Aker ASA has determined certain criteria
for allocation of the acceptances based on the best interest of the company and
equal treatment of the shareholders.

The trade date for the shares will be 18 December 2015 and settlement will take
place on 22 December 2015.

As a result of the buy back, Aker ASA owns 158 885 own shares, corresponding to
0.2 per cent of the share capital and votes in the company.

Arctic Securities ASA is engaged as financial advisor and receiving agent in
connection with the Offer.
