Reference  is made  to the  stock exchange  release of  Aker ASA (the "Company")
dated 22 December 2016 concerning an offer to buy back shares in connection with
the  Company's employee share purchase programme, as well as for other corporate
purposes (the "Offer"). The Offer expired on 22 December 2016 at 16:30 (CET).

The  Company has resolved to buy back 50 000 shares, as set out in the Offer, at
a  price of NOK 316 per  share. The price was  determined through a bookbuilding
process.  The total number  of acceptances exceeded  the amount of  shares to be
bought  back  under  the  Offer,  and  thus,  the Company has determined certain
criteria  of allocation  of the  acceptances based  on the  best interest of the
company and equal treatment of the shareholders.

The  trade date for the shares will be 23 December 2016 and settlement will take
place on 28 December 2016.

As  a result of  the buy back  and the settlement  of 10 099 shares purchased by
employees  under the Company's  share incentive programme  in December 2016, the
Company  owns 39 901 own  shares, corresponding  to 0.05 per  cent of  the share
capital and votes in the company.

Arctic  Securities ASA  is engaged  as financial  advisor and receiving agent in
connection with the Offer.
