after the end of the bookbuilding period, as well as to extend the bookbuilding

In the event that the total number of received acceptances exceeds 150 000
shares (or the increased amount of shares Aker ASA wishes to purchase), Aker ASA
will determine criteria for the allocation of the acceptances in accordance with
the best interest of the company and the equal treatment of the shareholders.

Allocation and pricing will follow before 09:00 (CET) on 18 December 2015. The
