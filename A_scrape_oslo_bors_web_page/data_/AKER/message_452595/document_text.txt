Reference is made to the stock exchange release of Aker ASA (the "Company")
dated 30 May 2018 concerning an offer to buy back shares in connection with the
Company's employee share purchase programme, the Company's employee bonus
scheme, as well as for other corporate purposes (the "Offer"). The Offer expired
on 31 May 2018 at 08:00 (CET).

The Company has resolved to buy back 50,000 shares, as set out in the Offer, at
a price of NOK 592 per share. The price was determined through a bookbuilding
process. The total number of acceptances exceeded the amount of shares to be
bought back under the Offer, and thus, the Company has determined certain
criteria of allocation of the acceptances based on the best interest of the
company and equal treatment of the shareholders.

The trade date for the shares will be 31 May 2018 and settlement will take place
on 4 June 2018.

As a result of the buy back, the Company owns 65,733 own shares, corresponding
to 0.1 per cent of the share capital and votes in the company.
