Aker ASA has on 10 December 2015 transferred its equity holding in Ocean Yield
ASA to Aker Capital AS, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Aker.

The purpose of the restructuring is to streamline and simplify Aker's holding
structure, as previously stated in Aker ASA's stock exchange notice dated 1
October 2015. As this is an internal restructuring within Aker ASA and holding
companies, it will have no effect on the combined Aker ASA and holding
companies' financial accounts.

As per 10 December 2015, Aker ASA directly held 98 242 575 of the issued shares
and votes in Ocean Yield ASA, or 72.97 per cent of the share capital.

Oslo Stock Exchange has on 30 September 2015, pursuant to section 6-2 (3) of the
Securities Trading Act, granted an exemption from the mandatory offer obligation
with respect to Aker Capital AS' acquisition of shares in Ocean Yield ASA.
