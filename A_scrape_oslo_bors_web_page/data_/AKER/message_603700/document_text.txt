Due to Kjell Inge Røkke's relocation to Lugano in September 2022, he triggered a
contingent tax liability ("Exit Tax") related to his personal ownership in The
Resource Group TRG AS ("TRG"). The contingent Exit Tax will only become payable
if Mr. Røkke divests his shares in TRG within five years from the date of his
relocation.

Due to Switzerland not being part of European Economic Area (Norwegian: EØS),
Norwegian Tax Authorities requires security for this temporary contingent tax
liability. Hence, Mr. Røkke has today pledged 20,465 shares in TRG, representing
35.2% of the outstanding shares in TRG, in favour of the Norwegian Tax
Authorities.

TRG is wholly owned by Kjell Inge Røkke, Chair of the Board and primary insider
in Aker ASA. TRG owns 95.71% of the shares in TRG Holding AS, which again owns
50,673,577 shares directly in Aker ASA, representing 68.18% of the outstanding
shares in the company.
