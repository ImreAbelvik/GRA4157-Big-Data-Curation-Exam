Aker ASA ("Aker") has on 30 September 2015 transferred its equity holdings in
Converto Capital Fund AS and Havfisk ASA to Aker Capital AS, a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Aker. Converto Capital Fund AS includes shareholdings in the
publicly-listed companies Aker Philadelphia Shipyard ASA and American Shipping
Company ASA ("AMSC").

The purpose of the restructuring is to streamline and simplify Aker's holding
structure. As this is an internal restructuring within Aker ASA and holding
companies, it will have no effect on the Aker ASA and holding companies'
financial accounts.

As per 30 September 2015, Aker directly held 62,001,793 of the issued shares and
votes in Havfisk ASA, or 73.25 per cent of the share capital. Through Converto
Capital Fund AS, Aker held 7,237,631 of the issued shares and votes in Aker
Philadelphia Shipyard ASA, or 57.56 per cent of the share capital; and
11,557,022 of the issued shares and votes in AMSC, or 19.07 per cent of the
share capital. Also through Converto Capital Fund AS, Aker had financial
exposure to 9,182,520 underlying shares in AMSC, equal to 15.15 per cent of the
share capital in AMSC, through a TRS agreement; and financial exposure to
4,005,100 underlying shares in AMSC, equal to 6.61 per cent of the share capital
of AMSC, through a second TRS agreement.

Oslo Stock Exchange has on 30 September 2015, pursuant to section 6-2 (3) of the
Securities Trading Act, granted an exemption from the mandatory offer obligation
with respect to Aker Capital AS' acquisition of shares in Havfisk ASA. The
transfer of the shares in Havfisk ASA to Aker Capital AS received the approval
of the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Fisheries on 29 September 2015.
