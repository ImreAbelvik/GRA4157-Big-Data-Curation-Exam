whereby the primary insider can choose to buy additional shares equal to 25% of
the bonus earned for 2020. All shares purchased hereunder are subject to a 3
year lock-up period and a 30% discount. The discount is based the volume
-weighted average share price of NOK 180.60 per share traded on Oslo Børs in the
period between 5 May 2021 - 11 May 2021. The shares where thus purchased at a
price of NOK 126.40 per share. The additional purchase is paid for by cash, or
loan from the company to be repaid over the next 12 months. The shares were
acquired from Multiconsult's holding of own shares. After the transactions the
