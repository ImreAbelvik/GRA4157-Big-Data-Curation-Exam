Oslo, Norway, 21 December 2022: In connection with the listing of Norsk Titanium AS (the "Company") on Euronext Growth Oslo, shareholders, individually, entered into a share lending agreement with NTi Holding AS ("NTi Holding") whereby their respective shares in the Company have been held on a separate Euronext VPS account in the name of NTi Holding AS. A total of 2,774,100 shares have now been redelivered upon the sole discretion and instruction by 16 individual shareholders to their respective accounts with Royal Bank of Canada New York. 

NTi Holding is not the beneficial owner of the shares and the transfer of shares does not represent a sale of shares by NTi Holding. NTi Holding will consequently neither increase nor decrease its ownership to shares in Norsk Titanium as a result of the redelivery. NTi Holding is a legal person closely associated with John Andersen, who is the chairman of the board of Norsk Titanium.
