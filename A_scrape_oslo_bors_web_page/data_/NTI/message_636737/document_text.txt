Oslo, Norway, 17 January 2025: Reference is made to the stock exchange announcement on 14 May 2024 where Norsk Titanium AS ("Norsk Titanium" or the "Company") announced that the general meeting of the Company had resolved to continue its long-term incentive program (the "LTIP"). In connection with the LTIP, the board of directors was authorised to administrate the LTIP and to increase the Company's share capital in order to execute the LTIP.

Participants in the Company's LTIP have on 17 January 2025 exercised a total of 996,762 Restricted Share Units ("RSU's").

Each RSU gives a right to acquire one share in the Company at a subscription price equal to the nominal value of the shares, being NOK 0.08. The RSUs are described in note 4.7 in Norsk Titanium's annual financial statements for 2023. The Company has resolved to settle 214,575 RSUs with cash consideration to allow the beneficiaries to settle taxes. The remaining 782,187 RSUs exercised will be settled by issuance of new shares in the Company.

Following the exercise, the Board of Directors, pursuant to authorisation granted by the Company's Annual General Meeting, has decided to increase the Company’s share capital by NOK 62,574.96 by issuing 782,187 new shares, of par value NOK 0.08. Subsequent to the transaction, Norsk Titanium's share capital will be NOK 64,233,324.16 divided into 802,916,552 shares, each share having a par value of NOK 0.0.8 and carrying one vote in the Company’s general meeting.

In addition, according to the authorisation the board of directors resolved to make a new total grant of 11,432,190 RSUs and performance shares (“Performance Shares”) in accordance with the LTIP. The total number of RSUs and Performance Shares granted by the board of directors equals 1.42% of total shares issued in the Company. 

The granted RSUs are subject to a time-based vesting. Of the total granted, 50% will vest rateably on each of the first three anniversaries of the grant date. Vesting of the Performance Shares is based on the achievement of financial or other performance goals. The number of Performance Shares that vest will be decided by the board of directors after year end 2027 with vesting on 17 January 2028.
