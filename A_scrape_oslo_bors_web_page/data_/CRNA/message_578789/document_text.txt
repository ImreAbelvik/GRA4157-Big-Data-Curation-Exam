About Targovax

Activating the patient's immune system to fight cancer

Targovax (OSE:TRVX) is a clinical stage immuno-oncology company developing
immune activators to target hard-to-treat solid tumors. Targovax's focus is to
activate the patient's immune system to fight cancer, and to bring benefit to
cancer patients with few available treatment alternatives. Targovax is
developing its product candidates in different cancer indications, including
melanoma, mesothelioma, and multiple myeloma, and has demonstrated a favorable
safety and tolerability profile.

Targovax's lead clinical candidate, ONCOS-102, is a genetically modified
oncolytic adenovirus, which has been engineered to selectively infect cancer
cells and activate the immune system against the tumor. Following very
encouraging clinical data in several indications, both as monotherapy and in
combinations, ONCOS-102 is progressing into a randomized phase 2 trial in
melanoma patients resistant to PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor treatment.

Building on successful clinical studies which have provided deep mechanistic
insights into the tumor biology and the human immune systems, Targovax is
researching circular RNA (circRNA) as novel cancer medicines. In addition,
Targovax has a KRAS immunotherapy program, with lead cancer vaccine candidate,
TG01, expected to enter the clinic in an enhanced format in the second half of
2022.  Together this provides Targovax with a rich pipeline of innovative future
immunotherapy product candidates to follow ONCOS-102.
