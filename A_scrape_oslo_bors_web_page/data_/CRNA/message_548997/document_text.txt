About Targovax

Activating the patient's immune system to fight cancer
Targovax (OSE:TRVX) is a clinical stage immuno-oncology company developing
immune activators to target hard-to-treat solid tumors. Targovax aims to unlock
greater clinical benefits in cancer patients by deploying its multifunctional
platforms to target key immune regulators and oncogenic drivers. Targovax's
focus is to "activate the patient's immune system to fight cancer", thus
extending and transforming the lives of cancer patients. Targovax's pipeline
aims at different cancer indications, including melanoma, mesothelioma and
colorectal cancer. The company's product candidates are designed to harness the
patient's own immune system to fight the cancer, whilst also delivering a
favorable safety and tolerability profile.

Targovax's lead clinical candidate, ONCOS-102, is a genetically modified
oncolytic adenovirus, which has been engineered to selectively infect cancer
cells and activate the immune system to fight the cancer. On the back of very
encouraging clinical data in several indications, both in monotherapy and in
multiple combinations, the next development steps for ONCOS-102 will be to
further improve responses in melanoma patients resistant to or poorly responsive
to current standard of care.
