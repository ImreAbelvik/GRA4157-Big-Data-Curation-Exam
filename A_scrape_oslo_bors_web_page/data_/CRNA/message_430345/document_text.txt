1. Exercise of employee share options

Berit Iversen, VP CMC of Targovax (the "Primary Insider"), has on 22 June 2017
subscribed for 25,000 shares in Targovax ASA at a price of NOK 7.5 per share in
connection with her exercise of vested employee options.

2. Transfer of rights and sale of shares

Following the subscription, the Primary Insider transferred 25,000 rights to
receive shares from the exercise of options to a third party. The Primary
Insider cannot be held liable for losses incurred by the third party if the
shares are later sold below the strike price.

Due to the cash impact for the Primary Insider of the exercise price and tax,
the Primary Insider is consequently selling shares in order to finance said cash
impact.

The third party sold 12,500 shares on behalf of the Primary Insider to cover
exercise price and taxes for the subscription of shares.

On behalf of the Primary Insider, the third party sold 12,500 shares for an
amount of NOK 262,393.75 which constitutes the Primary Insider's proceeds
following the exercise of 25,000 options deducted for exercise price and taxes.
The third party completed its sale in the market with an average sale price of
NOK 20,9915 per share.

3. New holding

Berit Iversen and her close associates will hold 20,087 shares and 135,000
employee options in Targovax ASA after the exercise of options.
