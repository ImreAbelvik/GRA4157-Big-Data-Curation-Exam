About Circio

Building next generation RNA technology for nucleic acid medicine

Circio Holding ASA is a biotechnology company developing powerful circular RNA
vector expression technology for next generation nucleic acid medicine.

Circio has established a unique circular RNA (circRNA) vector expression
platform for novel DNA, RNA and viral therapeutics. The proprietary circVec
technology is based on a modular genetic cassette design for efficient
biogenesis of multifunctional circRNA inside cells, which can be deployed in
multiple therapeutic settings, including genetic medicine, cell therapy and
chronic disease. The circVec platform has demonstrated up to 15-fold enhanced
and more significantly more durable protein expression vs. classic mRNA vector
systems and has the potential to become a new gold-standard platform technology
for nucleic acid and viral therapeutics in the future. The circRNA R&D
activities are being conducted by the wholly owned subsidiary Circio AB based at
the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden.

In addition, Circio is developing a pan-RAS cancer vaccine, TG01, targeting KRAS
driver mutations. TG01 is currently being tested in two clinical trials: RAS
-mutated pancreatic and lung cancer in the USA and multiple myeloma in Norway.
These studies are being run through academic and industry collaborative
networks, supported by prestigious research grants from Innovation Norway and
the Norwegian Research Council, creating read-outs and future optionality for
the program at low cost to Circio.
