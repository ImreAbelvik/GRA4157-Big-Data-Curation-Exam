Reference is made to the annual general meeting of Targovax ASA (the "Company")
on 29 April 2020 (the "AGM") where election of members to the board of directors
was according to the nomination committee's proposal. At the same AGM of the
Company the board of directors was authorized to extend the Company's restricted
stock unit ("RSU") program and to issue RSUs to the board members. The RSUs are
non-transferable and each RSU gives the right and obligation to acquire one
share in the Company at a price of NOK 0.10 per share (corresponding to the
nominal value of the shares) subject to satisfaction of the applicable vesting
conditions.

If the board members choose to receive the board remuneration in RSUs they must
elect to either (i) receive 100% of the compensation in RSUs, (ii) receive 1/3
of the compensation in cash and 2/3 in RSUs, or (iii) receive 2/3 of the
compensation in cash and 1/3 in RSUs. The number of RSUs is calculated on the
basis of a board remuneration of NOK 500 000 to the chairperson of the board and
NOK 290,000 to the other board members, divided by the market price of the
Company's shares calculated as the average share price for the 10 trading days
prior to the AGM being NOK 6.81 per share.

Robert Burns has resolved to receive his full board remuneration, as determined
by the Company's annual general meeting in 2020, in the form of RSUs and the
