About Targovax

Activating the patient's immune system to fight cancer

Targovax (OSE:TRVX) is a clinical stage immuno-oncology company developing
immune activators to target hard-to-treat solid tumors. Targovax's focus is to
activate the patient's immune system to fight cancer, and thereby bring benefit
to cancer patients with few available treatment alternatives. Targovax is
assessing its product candidates in different cancer indications, including
melanoma, mesothelioma and colorectal cancer, and has demonstrated a favorable
safety and tolerability profile.

Targovax's lead clinical candidate, ONCOS-102, is a genetically modified
oncolytic adenovirus, which has been engineered to selectively infect cancer
cells and activate the immune system to fight the cancer. On the back of very
encouraging clinical data in several indications, both as monotherapy and in
immunotherapy and chemotherapy combinations, the next development step for ONCOS
-102 will be to further improve immune activation and clinical response in
melanoma patients resistant to PD1 checkpoint blockade.
