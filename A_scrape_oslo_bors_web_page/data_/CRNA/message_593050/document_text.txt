Reference is made to the annual general meeting of Circio Holding ASA (the
"Company") on 22 May 2023 (the "AGM") where election of members to the board of
directors was according to the nomination committee's proposal. At the same AGM
of the Company the board of directors was authorized to extend the Company's
restricted stock unit ("RSU") program and to issue RSUs to the board members.
The RSUs are non-transferable and each RSU gives the right and obligation to
acquire one share in the Company at a price of NOK 0.10 per share (corresponding
to the nominal value of the shares) subject to satisfaction of the applicable
vesting conditions.

If the board members choose to receive the board remuneration in RSUs they must
elect to either (i) receive 100% of the compensation in RSUs, (ii) receive 1/3
of the compensation in cash and 2/3 in RSUs, or (iii) receive 2/3 of the
compensation in cash and 1/3 in RSUs. The number of RSUs is calculated on the
basis of a board remuneration of NOK 535 000 to the chairperson of the board and
NOK 320,000 to the other board members, divided by the market price of the
Company's shares calculated as the volume weighted average share price for the
10 trading days prior to the AGM being NOK 0.59 per share.

Damian Marron has resolved to receive 1/3 of the board remuneration, as
determined by the Company's annual general meeting in 2023, in the form of RSUs
and the board of directors has resolved to issue 302,670 RSUs to Damian Marron.
Damian Marron holds 400,435 RSUs, no options and no shares in the Company.

Diane Mellett has resolved to receive 2/3 of the board remuneration, as
determined by the Company's annual general meeting in 2023, in the form of RSUs
and the board of directors has resolved to issue 362,072 RSUs to Diane Mellett.
Diane Mellett holds 466,460 RSUs, no options and 122,948 shares in the Company.

Sonia Quaratino has resolved to receive 2/3 of the board remuneration, as
determined by the Company's annual general meeting in 2023, in the form of RSUs
and the board of directors has resolved to issue 362,072 RSUs to Sonia
Quaratino. Sonia Quaratino holds 506,242 RSUs, no options and no shares in the
Company.

Thomas Falck has resolved to receive 1/3 of the board remuneration, as

About Circio

Building next generation RNA therapeutics

Circio Holding ASA is a biotechnology company developing novel circular RNA and
immunotherapy medicines.

Building on deep experience in RNA biology, immunotherapy and viral vector
engineering, Circio has established a unique circular RNA (circRNA) platform to
develop novel circRNA medicines for cancer, vaccines, protein replacement for
genetic disorders and cell therapy. The proprietary circVec technology is based
on a modular genetic cassette design for efficient biogenesis of multifunctional
circRNA from DNA-based vectors that can be deployed for multiple purposes. The
most advanced therapeutic concept, circAde, builds on the company´s experience
in oncolytic viruses to use engineered adenoviruses for delivery of circRNA to
cancer cells. This unique approach is the only currently known circRNA program
targeting solid tumors. Circio´s strategy is to develop novel circAde cancer
medicines in-house and seek partnerships in other therapeutic areas to
demonstrate the broad potential of the circVec platform and accelerate our
circRNA pipeline development. The circRNA R&D activities are being conducted by
the wholly owned subsidiary Circio AB based at the Karolinska Institute in
Stockholm, Sweden.

Circio´s clinical immunotherapy programs are designed to activate the patient´s
own immune system to fight cancer cells and provide benefit to patients with no
or few treatment alternatives. Lead candidate ONCOS-102 is an oncolytic
adenovirus (AdV5) carrying a genetic cassette for mRNA-based expression of the
cytokine GM-CSF, designed to selectively target cancer cells and drive an anti
-tumor immune response. ONCOS-102 has demonstrated an excellent safety profile,
strong immune responses and clinical efficacy in several cancer types in Phase
1/2 studies, both as monotherapy and in combinations with checkpoint inhibitors
or standard-of-care chemotherapy. Circio is aiming to progress ONCOS-102 into a
phase 2 trial in melanoma patients resistant to PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor
treatment, subject to additional external financing and/or partnerships to
support the program.

Circio's second clinical stage program is an immunotherapy targeting KRAS driver
mutations. Lead candidate TG01 has previously shown robust immune responses and
encouraging clinical benefit in surgically resected pancreatic cancer, and is
currently being tested in two clinical trials in RAS-mutated pancreatic cancer
and multiple myeloma in the USA and Norway. These studies are being run through
industry and academic collaborative networks, supported by prestigious research
grants from Innovation Norway and the Norwegian Research Council, creating broad
future optionality for the TG01 program at low cost to Circio.
