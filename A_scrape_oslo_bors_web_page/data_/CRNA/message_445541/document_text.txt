Reference is made to the extraordinary general meeting of Targovax ASA (the
"Company") on 30 November 2017, where Patrick Vink was elected as chairman of
the Company's board of directors and the Company was authorized to issue
restricted stock units ("RSUs") to Patrick Vink. The RSUs are non-transferable
and each RSU gives the right and obligation to acquire one share in the Company
at a price of NOK 0.10 per share (corresponding to the nominal value of the
shares) subject to satisfaction of the applicable vesting conditions.

Patrick Vink has resolved to receive his full board remuneration, as determined
by the Company's extraordinary general meeting in November 2017, in the form of
RSUs and the Company has resolved to issue 11,131 RSUs to Patrick Vink.
Following the issuance, Patrick Vink holds 11,131 RSUs and no shares in the
Company.

The number of RSUs issued is calculated on the basis of his relative board
remuneration of NOK 162,740 divided by the market price of the Company's shares
calculated as the average share price for the 10 trading days prior to the
extraordinary general meeting, being NOK 14.62 per share.
