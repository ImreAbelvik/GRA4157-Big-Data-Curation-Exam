About Targovax

Activating the patient's immune system to fight cancer

Targovax (OSE:TRVX) is a clinical stage immuno-oncology company developing
immune activators to target hard-to-treat solid tumors. Targovax's focus is to
activate the patient's immune system to fight cancer, and to bring benefit to
cancer patients with few available treatment alternatives. Targovax is
developing its product candidates in different cancer indications, including
melanoma, mesothelioma, multiple myeloma and pancreatic cancer.

Targovax's lead clinical candidate, ONCOS-102, is a genetically modified
oncolytic adenovirus, which has been engineered to selectively infect cancer
cells and activate the immune system against the tumor. ONCOS-102 has
demonstrated a favorable efficacy, immunological and safety profile in several
indications, both as monotherapy and in combinations, and ONCOS-102 is
progressing into a randomized phase 2 trial in melanoma patients resistant to PD
-1 checkpoint inhibitor treatment.

Targovax has also established a cutting-edge circular RNA (circRNA) program with
the intent to develop next generation RNA therapeutics for various applications,
building on clinical experience and deep mechanistic insights from its first
generation products.  In addition, Targovax has a KRAS immunotherapy program,
with lead candidate TG01 due to enter clinical trials in an enhanced format in
pancreatic cancer and multiple myeloma during early 2023. This provides Targovax
with a rich pipeline of innovative future therapeutic candidates to follow ONCOS
-102.
