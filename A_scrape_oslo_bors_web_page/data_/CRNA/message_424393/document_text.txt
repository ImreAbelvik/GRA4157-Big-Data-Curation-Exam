authorize the Board of Targovax ASA to issue new shares to employees under the
Company long-term incentive program, the Board has resolved to issue new options

employed, with the first 1/36 vesting 13 months after the day of grant. The
exercise price of the options is NOK 21.96. The exercise price is equal to the
