December 16, 2016 - Aker Solutions employees bought shares for NOK 40 million as
part of annual programs for staff and managers.

The company for the eighth consecutive year held share purchase programs to
encourage employee ownership. About 900 employees, or 10 percent of eligible
staff, participated.

Eligible staff could buy Aker Solutions shares for as much as NOK 60,000 each.
The shares were offered at a 25 percent reduction on the market price and a
fixed one-off discount. A group of senior managers were also offered the chance
to buy additional shares for as much as 25 percent of each individual's salary.
These were also at a 25 percent price reduction.

The subscription period for employee and manager programs ran from Oct. 28 -
Nov. 11. The shares were allocated on Dec. 15 and priced at NOK 42.1910 each
before the price reduction and discount, which was the average volume weighted
share price of Aker Solutions on the Oslo Stock Exchange from Dec. 8 - 14.

Aker Solutions ASA sold a total of 938,357 own shares in connection with the
programs, leaving the company with 508,954 own shares.

Acquired shares are subject to a three-year lock-up during which employees will
not be able to sell the shares. Enclosed is an overview of shares acquired by
