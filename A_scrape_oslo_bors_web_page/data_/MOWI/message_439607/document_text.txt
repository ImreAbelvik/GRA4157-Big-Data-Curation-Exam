The Board of Directors of Marine Harvest ASA (the "Company") has resolved to
offer all permanent employees in the Company and its Norwegian, Scottish and
Canadian subsidiaries the opportunity to purchase shares in the Company at a
discounted price.

The offer to the employees is based on the average purchasing price for the
Company's shares on 27 November 2017 of NOK 145.9785 per share.

The Norwegian Tax Act §5-14 provides Norwegian employees with a right to
purchase shares with a discount of up to NOK 3,000 in such offer. Based on the
above, eligible employees in Norway have been given three alternative offers.
Alternative 1: Purchase 52 shares at a value of approximately NOK 7,500, with a
tax-free discount of NOK 1,500 and a purchase price around NOK 6,000.
Alternative 2: Purchase 103 shares at a value of approximately NOK 15,000, with
a tax-free discount of NOK 3,000 and a purchase price around NOK 12,000.
Alternative 3: Purchase 206 shares at a value of approximately NOK 30,000, with
a tax-free discount of NOK 3,000, a taxable discount of NOK 3,000 and a purchase
price around NOK 24,000.

Eligible employees in Scotland and Canada were given the same offers, however,
without any element of tax-free discount.

At the end of the acceptance period, the Company had received acceptances of
these offers from 760 employees for a total of 132,427 shares. To comply with
its obligation in relation to the acceptances received, the Company has, on 27
November 2017, purchased 132,427 shares in the market at an average price of NOK
145.9785. In total 132,427 shares will be sold to the employees having accepted
to participate in the share program on the terms referred to above.

In addition to the above mentioned transaction, Glenn Flanders, Chief Strategy
Officer, has purchased 206 American Depositary Receipts ("ADR") at NYSE at an
average price of USD 18.0879 per share. He has purchased such ADR's on the same
terms and conditions offered to eligible Marine Harvest employees in Scotland
and Canada.

The following primary insiders in the company have been allocated shares
according to the above and have, following this and adjustments for dividends
paid, the following number of shares and options in the company:
