Framar AS (Framar), a company controlled by Marine Harvest ASA's (Marine
Harvest) Chairman Ole-Eirik Lerøy, and Sterna Finance Ltd (Sterna), a company
indirectly controlled by trusts established by John Fredriksen for the benefit
of his immediate family, have on 11 November 2018 entered into a commercial two-
and-a-half-year marine sector consultancy agreement.


In connection with the consultancy agreement, Sterna and Framar have entered
into a separate dividend adjusted option agreement whereby Sterna has granted
Framar an option to acquire 750,000 shares in Marine Harvest. The premium paid
by Framar for the option is NOK 3,750,000. The option may be exercised by Framar
once, and only for the full number of shares, between 11 May 2019 and 11 May
2021. The strike price is set at NOK 229.90 per share, reflecting the closing
price of the Marine Harvest share on 9 November 2018 plus a 5 % annual interest
component till maturity. In case of early exercise, the interest component of
the strike price will be reduced correspondingly.

If the option is exercised, Sterna will acquire a corresponding number of shares
from Geveran Trading Co Limited (Geveran), a company indirectly controlled by
trusts established by John Fredriksen for the benefit of his immediate family,
in order to settle the option, in which case Geveran's holding of shares in
Marine Harvest will be reduced to 77,801,603 shares (based on today's
shareholding), representing 15.57 % of the share capital and voting rights in
the company.

If the option is exercised by Framar, Ole-Eirik Lerøy and his affiliates will
own 2,250,332 shares in Marine Harvest, corresponding to 0.45 % of the share
capital and voting rights in the company.
