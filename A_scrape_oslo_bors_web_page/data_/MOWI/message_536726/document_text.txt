At Mowi ASA's (the "Company") annual general meeting ("AGM") on 9 June 2021 the
Board of Directors was authorised to grant options under the Share Option Scheme
to Senior Executives, as described in Mowi's guidelines for remuneration of
leading personnel (the "Guidelines"). On 23 June 2021 the Board of Directors
granted 1.675 million options with a strike price of NOK 247.1395, corresponding
to 107.5% of the volume weighted average share price on the Oslo Stock Exchange
at the date of the AGM, to a total of 34 individuals.

In accordance with the Guidelines , the options have a term of 4 years but will
become exercisable immediately if a mandatory bid is made for all of the shares
in Mowi, if a voluntary offer is followed-up with a forced transfer of shares in
accordance with the Norwegian Securities Trading Act or if Mowi is the non-
surviving entity in a merger with another company.

The number of shares and the strike price will be adjusted for dividends and
changes in the equity capital during the term of the option according to the
Oslo Stock Exchange's derivative rules and provisions in the option agreements.
Total profit through the exercise of the option in a year is capped at two
years' salary for the option holder. If the profit exceeds this limit, the
number of shares to be issued will be reduced accordingly.

The following primary insiders in the Company have been allocated options
according to the above, please see attached allocation details. The primary
insiders have the following number of shares and options, adjusted for dividends
paid, in the Company.
