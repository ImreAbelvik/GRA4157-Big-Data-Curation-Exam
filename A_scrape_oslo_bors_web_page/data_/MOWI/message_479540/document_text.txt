Number of options exercised

The Board of Directors of Mowi awarded 1.175 million options under its senior
executive share option scheme with effect from 2015 to the current participants
in the option scheme. The option scheme forms an important part of Mowi's long-
term remuneration policy for such senior executives. The number of options shall
be reduced if the profit through exercise of options in a year exceeds two times
the fixed annual salary of the option holder. Accordingly, the number of options
has been reduced to 485,743 options to comply with this provision.



On 17 June 2019, participants in Mowi's senior executive share option scheme
exercised 485,743 options in Mowi, corresponding to 485,743 shares at a strike
price of NOK 77.52 per share.



On the same date Mowi purchased 485,743 own shares at a price of NOK 203.81 per
share to settle its obligation to deliver the shares. The shares were purchased
in accordance with the authorisation granted at the annual general meeting on
29 May 2019. Following these transactions Mowi still holds zero treasury shares.
