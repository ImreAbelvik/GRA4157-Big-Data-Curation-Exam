Number of options exercised

The Board of Directors of Mowi awarded 0.9 million options under its senior
executive share option scheme with effect from 2016 to the current participants
in the option scheme. The option scheme forms an important part of Mowi's long-
term remuneration policy for such senior executives. The number of options shall
be adjusted for dividend payments and reduced if the profit through exercise of
options in a year exceeds two times the fixed annual salary of the option
holder. Accordingly, the number of options has been adjusted to 1.0 million
options to comply with these provisions.

On 22 June 2020, participants in Mowi's senior executive share option scheme
exercised 1,022,084 options in Mowi, corresponding to 1,022,084 shares at a
strike price of NOK 119.84 per share.

On the same date Mowi purchased 1,022,084 own shares at a price of NOK 179.17
per share to settle its obligation to deliver the shares. The shares were
purchased in accordance with the authorisation granted at the annual general
meeting on 3 June 2020. Following these transactions Mowi still holds zero
treasury shares.
