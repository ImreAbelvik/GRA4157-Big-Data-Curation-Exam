Number of options exercised

The Board of Directors of Mowi awarded 0.925 million options under its senior
executive share option scheme with effect from 2018 to the current participants
in the option scheme. The option scheme forms an important part of Mowi's long-
term remuneration policy for such senior executives. The number of options shall
be adjusted for dividend payments and reduced if the profit through exercise of
options in a year exceeds two times the fixed annual salary of the option
holder. Accordingly, the number of options has been adjusted to 994,692 options
to comply with these provisions.

On 22 June 2022, participants in Mowi's senior executive share option scheme
exercised 994,692 options in Mowi, corresponding to 994,692 shares at a strike
price of NOK 157.53 per share.

On the same date Mowi purchased 994,692 own shares at a price of NOK 225.00 per
share to settle its obligation to deliver the shares. The shares were purchased
in accordance with the authorisation granted at the annual general meeting on
13 June 2022. Following these transactions Mowi still holds zero treasury
shares.
