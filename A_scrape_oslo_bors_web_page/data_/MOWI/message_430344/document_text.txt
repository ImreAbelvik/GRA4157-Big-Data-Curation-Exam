At the Company's annual general meeting on 1 June 2017 (AGM) the Board of
Directors was authorised to grant options under the Share Option Scheme for
Senior Executives. On 22 June 2017 the Board of Directors granted 1.5 million
options with a strike price of NOK 161.7566, corresponding to 107.5% of the
volume weighted average share price on the Oslo Stock Exchange at the date of
the AGM, to a total of 22 individuals.

The options have a term of 4 years but will become exercisable immediately if a
mandatory bid is made for all of the shares in Marine Harvest, if a voluntary
offer is followed up with a forced transfer of shares in accordance with the
Norwegian Securities Trading Act or if Marine Harvest is the non-surviving
entity in a merger with another company.

The number of shares and the strike price will be adjusted for dividends and
changes in the equity capital during the term of the option according to the
Oslo Stock Exchange's derivative rules and provisions in the option agreements.
Total profit through the exercise of the option in a year is capped at two
years' salary for the option holder. If the profit exceeds this limit, the
number of shares to be issued will be reduced accordingly.

The following primary insiders in the company have been allocated options
according to the above and have, following this and adjustments for dividends
paid, the following number of shares and options in the company:
