The Board of Directors of Marine Harvest ASA (the "Company") has resolved to
offer all permanent employees in the Company and its Norwegian, Scottish and
Canadian subsidiaries the opportunity to purchase shares in the Company at a
discounted price.

The offer to the employees is based on the average purchasing price for the
Company's shares on 5 December 2018 of NOK 199.418 per share.

The Norwegian Tax Act §5-14 provides Norwegian employees with a right to
purchase shares with a discount of up to NOK 3,000 in such offer. Based on the
above, eligible employees in Norway have been given three alternative offers.
Alternative 1: Purchase 38 shares at a value of approximately NOK 7,500, with a
tax-free discount of NOK 1,500 and a purchase price around NOK 6,000.
Alternative 2: Purchase 76 shares at a value of approximately NOK 15,000, with a
tax-free discount of NOK 3,000 and a purchase price around NOK 12,000.
Alternative 3: Purchase 151 shares at a value of approximately NOK 30,000, with
a tax-free discount of NOK 3,000, a taxable discount of NOK 3,000 and a purchase
price around NOK 24,000.

Eligible employees in Scotland and Canada were given the same offers, however,
without any element of tax-free discount.

At the end of the acceptance period, the Company had received acceptances of
these offers from 833 employees for a total of 109,823 shares. To comply with
its obligation in relation to the acceptances received, the Company has, on 5
December 2018, purchased 109,823 shares in the market at an average price of NOK
199.418. In total 109,823 shares will be sold to the employees having accepted
to participate in the share program on the terms referred to above.

The following primary insiders in the company have been allocated shares
according to the above and have, following this and adjustments for dividends
paid, the following number of shares and options in the company:
