Number of options exercised

The Board of Directors of Mowi awarded 0.9 million options under its senior
executive share option scheme with effect from 2017 to the current participants
in the option scheme. The option scheme forms an important part of Mowi's long-
term remuneration policy for such senior executives. The number of options shall
be adjusted for dividend payments and reduced if the profit through exercise of
options in a year exceeds two times the fixed annual salary of the option
holder. Accordingly, the number of options has been adjusted to 764,101 options
to comply with these provisions.

On 22 June 2021, participants in Mowi's senior executive share option scheme
exercised 764,101 options in Mowi, corresponding to 764,101 shares at a strike
price of NOK 136.51 per share.

On the same date Mowi purchased 764,101 own shares at a price of NOK 233.83 per
share to settle its obligation to deliver the shares. The shares were purchased
in accordance with the authorisation granted at the annual general meeting on 9
June 2021. Following these transactions Mowi still holds zero treasury shares.
