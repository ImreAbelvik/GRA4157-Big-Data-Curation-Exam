Energeia is positioned to become a significant contributor to renewable energy production in Norway, with operations and a strong position for growth in the Netherlands. Although the sale and mutual option agreement comes as a direct consequence of the damages incurred to our group from the 2014 fraud, I am happy that my personal financial efforts have resulted in today’s Energeia group with 1 800 shareholders, a strong balance sheet and solid financial position. I am very grateful for the trust the Obligo has placed in me and our future collaboration in developing Energeia AS further.”
