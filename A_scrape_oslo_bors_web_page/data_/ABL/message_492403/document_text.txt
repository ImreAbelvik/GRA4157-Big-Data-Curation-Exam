(Oslo, 20 December 2019) The Board of Directors of AqualisBraemar ASA (the “Company”) has implemented a long-term incentive plan (the “LTIP”) aimed to align the interests of the participating employees with those of the Company's shareholders. 

Under the LTIP, the Company has granted a total of 8,505,000 share options to selected employees, where each option will give the holder the right to acquire one share in AqualisBraemar ASA. The options are granted without consideration. The grant of options is based on the authorization granted by the annual general meeting on 11 June 2019 to issue new shares in connection with the Company’s employee incentive program.

The exercise price for the options is NOK 3.96, equal to the issue price in the rights issue and private placement completed on 9 July 2019.  The options will vest and become exercisable on 11 June 2022, three years after the authorization granted by the annual general meeting. All unexercised options will expire nine months after vesting. Exercise periods will be set by the Company. 

The options are non-tradable and conditional upon the option holder being employed by the Company and not having resigned prior to exercise.

Subject to certain conditions, the option holders are obligated to reinvest 25 percent of the pre-tax net gain on the options in AqualisBraemar shares, and to hold these shares for up to three years following exercise. One third of these shares will be released from this obligation for every year following exercise.

The Board of Directors may choose to settle the options by way of cash settlement in lieu of issuing new shares. Exercise terms may be reasonably adjusted by the Board of Directors in the event of dividend payments, share splits or certain other events relating to the equity share capital of the Company.
