Based on 2024 results and after evaluation of the performance criteria, the Company has awarded 134,383 shares to employees as part of its Short Term Incentive Program (STIP) and 440,386 shares to employees as part of its Long Term Incentive Program (LTIP).  
 
Settlement of shares under the STIP will be done through use of treasury shares. Following completion of the settlement under STIP, ABL Group owns a total of 113,830 of its own shares, corresponding to 0,087 % of ABL Group's share capital.

With respect to the LTIP 2024, the employees will surrender their 2024 Performance Share Units (PSUs) and in return LTIP shares will be delivered to the relevant employees in 2026 (50% of award) and 2027 (50% of award), provided the employee remains employed with ABL Group through the settlement dates as well as no breach of employment conditions and/or ABL Group Code of Conduct.

In addition, as part of LTIP 2025, the Company will issue new awards of PSUs to key employees of the Company, being part of the executive and senior leadership teams (each a PSU Holder).  The PSUs give the PSU Holder the right to receive shares in the Company depending on the achievement of certain performance criteria and subject to continued employment on the relevant settlement dates. The conversion of PSUs to shares will be determined by performance against two target metrics: (i) group adjusted EBIT and (ii) return on capital employed. Each of the performance metrics is measured for the period 1 January 2025 through 31 December 2025. The Company will notify each PSU Holder of the total achieved performance and the number of shares earned by the PSU Holder after announcement of the Q4 results for 2025. The shares will be delivered to the PSU Holder in 2027 (50%) and 2028 (50%), provided the PSU Holder remains employed with ABL Group through the settlement dates as well as no breach of employment conditions and/or ABL Group Code of Conduct. Settlement of PSUs will be done through use of treasury shares or by issuance of new shares, as decided by the Board of Directors. A total of 1,100,000 shares are to be designated for settlement of the 2025 PSUs which takes into account the maximum achievement under the scheme. 
 
The Company will also continue the annual STIP for all employees in the group. All employees are awarded a bonus opportunity subject to the achievement of certain performance conditions. The performance under the STIP for the financial year 2025 will be considered by the Board after announcement of the Q4 results for 2025. Payments will be made in cash and/or shares as decided by the Board of Directors.
