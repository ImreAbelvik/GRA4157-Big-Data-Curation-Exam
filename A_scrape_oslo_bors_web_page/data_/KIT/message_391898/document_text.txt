  Non-allocated                                       2 500 000


Each option entitles the holder to subscribe one share in Kitron. The options
are allocated without consideration and with a strike price at NOK 0.10. The
options have a vesting period of three years with full vesting at the end of the
vesting period, provided that the following conditions are fulfilled:

  * Each manager must remain an employee of Kitron or an affiliated company at
    the end of the vesting period.
  * The market cap of Kitron must have increased in the vesting period, being
    the period between [date] and [date].
  * When determining the development in Kitron's stock market price, the volume
    weighted average quotation on Oslo Børs in the three months prior to 1 July
    2016 (the "Initial Reference Price") shall be compared with the volume
    weighted average quotation on Oslo Børs in the three months period
    commencing two months prior to and ending one month after expiry of the
    vesting period (the "Final Reference Price").
  * If the Final Reference Price is the same or lower than the Initial Reference
    Price, no share options shall vest.
  * If the Final Reference Price is 100% or more than the Initial Reference
    Price, all options shall vest.
  * If the Final Reference Price implies an increase in the stock market price
    of between 0 % and 100% compared to the Initial Reference Price, the options
    shall vest linearly.
The options shall be adjusted in case of certain amendments to the Kitron's
share capital. The options shall regardless of the vesting period be vested if a
public offer is made for the shares in the Company and the number of shares
vesting will depend on the offer price.

After the allocation of options the mentioned persons have, together with
related parties, the following holding of shares and rights to shares in the
Company:
