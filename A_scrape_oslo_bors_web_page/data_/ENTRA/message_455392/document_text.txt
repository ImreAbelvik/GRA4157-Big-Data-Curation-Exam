Entra ASA ("Entra") has decided to initiate a share buy-back program for up to
2% of the registered shares, representing up to 3,674,649 shares.

Up to 2,447,272 of the total 3,674,649 shares will be repurchased in the market.
The remaining up to 1,227,377 shares will be purchased from the Norwegian state
pursuant to an agreement between Entra and the Ministry of Trade, Industry and
Fisheries. According to the agreement the Ministry is committed to participate
in a share buy-back program on a proportionate basis so that the Ministry's
ownership interest in Entra of 33.4% remains unchanged.

Entra has put in place a non- discretionary program (the "Program") for the
repurchase of up to 2,447,272 of its ordinary shares (the "Shares"). The Program
will be managed by third parties, which will make its trading decisions in
relation to the Shares independently of, and uninfluenced by, Entra. Please note
this may result in Entra buying shares through periods where the company
otherwise would have been restricted.

The shares will be repurchased in accordance with the authorisation given by
Entra's AGM on 20 April 2018. Entra will seek approval by the AGM in April 2019
for cancellation of the repurchased shares and a corresponding redemption of the
proportionate shares from the Ministry. The market repurchases will have
immediate cash flow effects whereas the pro rata redemption from the Ministry
will be paid in second quarter 2019.

The buy-back program will be in force until the maximum number of shares as set
out above has been acquired, unless the Board resolves to terminate the program
at an earlier time.
