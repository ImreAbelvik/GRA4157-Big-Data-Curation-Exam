The Board of Directors of Atea ASA has resolved to initiate a share repurchase
program. The share repurchase program is in accordance with the power of
attorney granted to the Board by the Annual General Meeting of Atea ASA on April
29, 2025.
The share repurchase program will be for a maximum consideration of NOK 140
million, and for a maximum of 800,000 shares. The program will commence on
August 18, 2025 and continue until April 30, 2026 or until the maximum number of
shares has been repurchased. Buyback transactions will be executed according to
the market price on the Oslo Stock Exchange, and the maximum price to be paid
per share under the program is NOK 190. Shares repurchased under the program
will be used to fulfill the company's obligations under its share-based
compensation agreements. Atea will appoint a financial institution to carry out
the share repurchase program.
The maximum number of shares purchased per day will be 25% of the average daily
turnover in the 20 trading days preceding the date of purchase. This limit is in
accordance with Market Abuse Regulation (MAR) requirements as described in
Article 3 of the EU Commission delegated regulation 2016/1052, and as
