insiders

Today a primary insider in Schibsted ASA, Andrew Kvålseth, has been granted
restricted B shares in connection with the long-term incentive plan (the
"Executive LTI Plan"), in addition to an extraordinary share allocation as
stated in his employment agreement.



The Executive LTI Plan is an annual 3-year rolling plan, part delivered in
restricted shares and part delivered in performance shares, with fulfilment in
Schibsted B-shares. The program is applicable to the CEO, the members of
Schibsted's Executive Team as well as to a few selected key roles, and will be
transferred at the end of the 3-year program period.



The extraordinary share allocation consists of Schibsted B shares. 50% of the
award will vest 1 year following the grant date and 50% 2 years following the
grant date. The shares will be transferred to the grantee following each of the
vesting dates. 



For more information on the LTI Plan, please refer to Schibsted ASA's annual
report 2020 under the section "The Board of Directors' Statement of Executive
Compensation for Schibsted excluding Adevinta".



Please see the attached form(s) for notification and public disclosure of

insiders.
