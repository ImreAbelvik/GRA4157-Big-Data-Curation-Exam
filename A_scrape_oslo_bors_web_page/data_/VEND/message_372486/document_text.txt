Saving Plan 2015 for
employees of the
Schibsted Group and
subscription from
primary insider
employees

Reference is made to
the stock exchange
published 9 April
2014 regarding the
Schibsted Employee
Share Saving Plan.

The plan is
continued for 2015.
The plan is offered
to employees in the
Group working for
companies where
Schibsted's
ownership is more
than 50%. The
purpose of the plan
is to motivate and
retain employees as
well as to increase
the interest for the
Group's results and
performance through
owning Schibsted
shares.

For 2015, the
company offers a
share saving plan
based on an annual
savings range of NOK
2,000 - NOK 50,000
(or equivalent in
local currency) but
maximum 5% of annual
gross fixed salary.
Employees can enroll
and change the
savings amount
quarterly. The
savings amount is
deducted from the
monthly net salary.
The savings amount
is used to purchase
Schibsted shares
quarterly on behalf
of the employees.
The purchase of
shares will take
place through DNB on
the day or days
following
publication of the
interim accounts.
The first purchase
will take place
after the
publication of the
Q1 2015 interim
report. The purchase
price and the number
of shares acquired
by the company will
be reported in
accordance with the
applicable
regulations.
Employees will be
allocated shares at
the purchase price
which is the market
price on the
purchase date (i.e.
no discount).

After two years of
ownership, the
company will
allocate one bonus
share for every two
shares bought in
connection with this
offer.

Attached to this
release is a list of
employees that are
primary insiders and
that have subscribed
in the share saving
plan for 2015. The
subscribed amount
disclosed is the
total amount in NOK
for 2015. Primary
insiders cannot
change the savings
amount quarterly.
The purchase price
and the number of
shares will be
reported when
allocation is done.
