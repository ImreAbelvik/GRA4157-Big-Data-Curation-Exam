has today approved the allocation of a maximum of 7,217,260 options linked to
the Company's shares under an incentive scheme (the "Options") to members of the

performance. The time-based vesting is quarterly, over 4 years (1-year cliff).

growth in the share price from the start date (i.e. 10% or less annual growth
means no options vest). The maximum Options vest if 25% or higher compounding
share price growth has been achieved. There is a linear increase in vesting
between 10% and 25%.

The vested Options may be exercised in designated exercise windows during a five
year period subject to a possible extension of three additional years. The

cash at the discretion of the Company.
