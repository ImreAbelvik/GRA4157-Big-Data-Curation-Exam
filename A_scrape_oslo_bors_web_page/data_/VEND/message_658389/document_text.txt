Reference is made to the stock exchange announcement on September 28, 2022,
published by SATS ASA (the "Company") in connection with the share investment
program implemented in 2022 (the "2022 Share Investment Program").

As part of the 2022 Share Investment Program, certain senior executives and
other key employees (the "Participants"), could be rewarded additional shares
in the Company without consideration (the "Matching Shares") in the ratio
0.33:1 based on the number of shares originally acquired under the program,
subject to certain conditions being fulfilled.
 
The conditions for awarding Matching Shares have been fulfilled. The board of
directors has therefore resolved to award a total of 126,287 shares to four
participants in the 2022 Share Investment Program.
 
The value of the Matching Shares is NOK 33.17 each, representing the trading
price of the Company's shares at the close of trading on October 29, 2025,
with a 10.12% discount to reflect the one-year lock-up obligation.
 
The Company's obligation to award Matching Shares will be settled by existing
shares in the Company, held in treasury. Prior to the award of Matching
Shares, the Company owned 4,922,241 shares. Following the award, the Company
will have 4,795,954 shares in treasury, representing approximately 2.35% of
the issued share capital.
 
Certain primary insiders and close associates of primary insiders of the
Company have been awarded Matching Shares. See details below and in the
attached forms:
 
* Mira Investments AS, a close associate of Sondre Gravir (CEO), has been
awarded 88,107 Matching Shares in the Company.

awarded 5,874 Matching Shares in the Company.
* Evert Holding AS, a close associate of Wenche Evertsen (Country Manager
  Norway), has been awarded 8,811 Matching Shares in the Company.
 
The above transactions are notifiable pursuant to Article 19 of the Market
Abuse Regulation.
