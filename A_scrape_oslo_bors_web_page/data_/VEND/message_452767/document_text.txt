after release of Schibsted's Q1 report, the closing price 7 May 2018). The
shares will be transferred to the participants in the coming days. The
transaction is related to the first enrolment window in the Employee Share
Saving Plan for 2018 which closed in December, and based on savings made during
January, February and March.

In addition, Schibsted Media Group has on 31 May 2018 transferred 5,136 treasury
B-shares to participants in the Employee Share Saving Plan at a price of NOK
218.00 per B-share (the closing price on the vesting date for the two year

In addition, Schibsted Media Group has on 31 May 2018 bought 1,317 treasury A-
shares from participants in the Employee Share Saving Plan at a price of NOK
236.00 per A-share (the closing price on 14 May 2018). The reason for the A-
share transfer is subject to the MiFID II - Directive, regulating banks not to
sell shares on behalf of persons without a direct customer relationship with the
bank. Schibsted's non-Norwegian Employee Share Saving Plan participants
currently falls under this category and are subject to these regulations.
Schibsted ASA has therefore acquired these A-shares to fulfil the participants
right to sell shares according to Terms & Conditions of the Employee Share
Saving Plan.

shares are disclosed in the attachment.
