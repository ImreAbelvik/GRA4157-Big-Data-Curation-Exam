the CEO appointment. Reference is made to stock exchange release on 23 May 2025.

The options will expire after five years (1 August 2030) and may be exercised in
the last two years. The strike price of the options is NOK 219.31, based on the
volume-weighted average share price (VWAP) over the last three trading days in
July 2025 (29, 30 and 31 July), plus a 10% premium. The strike price will be
adjusted for dividends and other equity transactions.
