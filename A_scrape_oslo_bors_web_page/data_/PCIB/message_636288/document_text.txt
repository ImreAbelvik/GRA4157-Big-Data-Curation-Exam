Oslo,  10 January 2025 - PCI Biotech (OSE: PCIB), today announced that the Board
of  Directors has granted share options to  Morten Luhr who has been promoted to
Chief  Scientific Officer  (CSO) from  January 2025. Anders  Høgset, former CSO,
will commence as Scientific Advisor in a 20% position.

In  accordance with the authorisation granted  by the Annual General Meeting 24
May  2024 and the remuneration policy adopted  by the Annual General Meeting 28
May  2021, the Board of Directors of PCI Biotech Holding ASA ("PCI Biotech") has
awarded  a total of  75,000 share options to  a key employee.  Each share option
gives  the right  to subscribe  for or  acquire one  share per option (after PCI
Biotech's  choice), at a strike price of  NOK 1.35, equal to the volume weighted
average share price (VWAP) for the last 5 days of trade prior to the grant date.
The  share options are granted without consideration and are subject to service-
based  vesting conditions. The share options  will vest annually with 1/3 over a
three-year vesting term. The first 1/3 will vest in Q3 2025 and the vesting term
ends in Q3 2027. The share options are lapsing in Q3 2029. Further details about
the share option program are described in PCI Biotech's remuneration policy.

The  number  of  share  options  granted  is  based  on  these guidelines and in
addition,  the share options are granted with a value cap of 20 times the strike
price.  If  this  value  cap  threshold  is  met  all  share  options  will vest
immediately and be available for exercise.

To  ensure  long-term  ownership  by  executive  management,  shares obtained by
exercise  of share options shall be held for at least one year, except shares to
be  sold immediately to cover transaction costs  and tax under a so-called cash-
less exercise. Through the long-term incentive program the board expects members
of  the executive team  to build up  and maintain share  ownership with a market
value  equal to at  least one-year gross  base salary, before  any shares may be
sold.

All  75,000 share options were allotted to Morten Luhr, CSO and primary insider.
After  the allotment, Morten Luhr holds a total portfolio of 560,000 unexercised
share options and 70 shares.

Primary  insider notifications pursuant  to the market  abuse regulation article
19 are attached.

The  current authorisation, as of 24 May  2024, allows for a total of 2,790,000
share  options,  of  which  2,463,334 now  have  been  granted  by  the Board of
Directors.
