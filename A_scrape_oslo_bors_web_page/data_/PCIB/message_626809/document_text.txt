Oslo,  2 September 2024 - PCI Biotech (OSE: PCIB), today announce that the Board
of Directors has granted share options to key employees.

In  accordance with the authorisation granted  by the Annual General Meeting 24
May  2024 and the remuneration policy adopted  by the Annual General Meeting 28
May  2021, the Board of Directors of PCI Biotech Holding ASA ("PCI Biotech") has
awarded  a total  of 885,000 share  options to  key employees. Each share option
gives  the right  to subscribe  for or  acquire one  share per option (after PCI
Biotech's  choice), at a strike price of  NOK 1.81, equal to the volume weighted
average share price (VWAP) for the last 5 days of trade prior to the grant date.
The  share options are granted without consideration and are subject to service-
based  vesting conditions, and the share options will vest equally over a three-
year  vesting term.  The share  options are  lapsing in Q3 2029. Further details
about  the  share  option  program  are  described in PCI Biotech's remuneration
policy.

According  to the remuneration policy the BoD will at allotment of share options
seek  to allot  a number  of share  options with  a total fair value, calculated
according  to the Black-Scholes model, that is  partly linked to the annual base
salary  for  each  individual.  Other  elements  that  will  be  assessed in the
allotment  are the balance between  total short- and long-term performance-based
rewards,  current  value  of  share  options  held,  overall  performance,  work
responsibility, importance of retention, and position.

The  number  of  share  options  granted  is  based  on  these guidelines and in
addition,  the share options are granted with a value cap of 20 times the strike
price.  If  this  value  cap  threshold  is  met  all  share  options  will vest
immediately and be available for exercise.

To  ensure  long-term  ownership  by  executive  management,  shares obtained by
exercise  of share options shall be held for at least one year, except shares to
be  sold immediately to cover transaction costs  and tax under a so-called cash-
less exercise. Through the long-term incentive program the board expects members
of  the executive team  to build up  and maintain share  ownership with a market
value  equal to at  least one-year gross  base salary, before  any shares may be
sold.

Of  the  885,000 share  options,  530,000 share  options  were  allotted  to the
following primary insiders:

400,000 share  options were allotted to Ronny  Skuggedal, CEO and CFO. After the
allotment,  Ronny  Skuggedal  holds  a  total portfolio of 1,020,000 unexercised
share options and 55,000 shares.

130,000 share  options were allotted to Anders Høgset, CSO. After the allotment,
Anders  Høgset holds a total portfolio  of 460,000 unexercised share options and
64,800 shares.

19 are attached.

The  current authorisation, as of 24 May  2024, allows for a total of 2,790,000
