In  accordance with the authorisation granted  by the Annual General Meeting 29
May  2019, the Board of Directors of PCI Biotech Holding ASA has awarded a total

share price (VWAP) for the last 5 days of trade prior to the grant date.

The  share options  can be  exercised with  1/3 of the  options after  one year,
further 1/3 after two years and the last third after three years. To ensure long

years  after exercise, except shares to be sold immediately to cover transaction
costs  and  tax  under  a  so  called  cash less exercise. The share options are
