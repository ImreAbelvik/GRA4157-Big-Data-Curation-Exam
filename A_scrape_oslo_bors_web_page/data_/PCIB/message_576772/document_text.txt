Oslo,  25 November 2022 - PCI Biotech (OSE: PCIB), today announce that the Board
of Directors has granted share options to key employees.

In  accordance with the authorisation granted  by the Annual General Meeting 25
May  2022 and the remuneration policy adopted  by the Annual General Meeting 28
May  2021, the Board of Directors of PCI Biotech Holding ASA ("PCI Biotech") has
awarded  a total  of 570,000 share  options to  key employees. Each share option
gives  the right  to subscribe  for or  acquire one  share per option (after PCI
Biotech's  choice), at a strike price of  NOK 1.90, equal to the volume weighted
average share price (VWAP) for the last 5 days of trade prior to the grant date.
However, the current nominal value of the share is NOK 3.00 and the strike price
cannot  be lower  than the  nominal value  of the  share at  the future exercise
date(s).  The share options are granted without consideration and are subject to
service based vesting conditions, and the share options will vest equally over a
three-year  vesting  term.  The  share  options  are lapsing in Q3 2027. Further
details   about  the  share  option  program  are  described  in  PCI  Biotech's
remuneration policy.

According  to the remuneration policy the BoD will at allotment of share options
seek  to allot  a number  of share  options with  a total fair value, calculated
according  to the Black-Scholes model, that is  partly linked to the annual base
salary  for  each  individual.  Other  elements  that  will  be  assessed in the
allotment  are the balance  between total short-  and longterm performance based
rewards,  current  value  of  share  options  held,  overall  performance,  work
responsibility, importance of retention and position.

The  number  of  share  options  granted  is  based  on  these guidelines and in
addition,  the share options are granted with a value cap of 20 times the strike
price  of NOK 1.90. If  this value cap  threshold is met  all share options will
vest immediately and be available for exercise.

To  ensure  long-term  ownership  by  executive  management,  shares obtained by
exercise  of share options shall be held for at least one year, except shares to
be  sold immediately to cover  transaction costs and tax  under a so-called cash
less exercise. Through the long-term incentive program the board expects members
of  the executive team  to build up  and maintain share  ownership with a market
value  equal to at  least one-year gross  base salary, before  any shares may be
sold. No lock-up elements are applicable for other employees.

Of  the  570,000 share  options,  360,000 share  options  were  allotted  to the
following primary insiders:

220,000 share   options  were  allotted  to  Ronny  Skuggedal,  CEO.  After  the
allotment,  Ronny Skuggedal holds a total portfolio of 360,000 unexercised share
options and 55,000 shares.
