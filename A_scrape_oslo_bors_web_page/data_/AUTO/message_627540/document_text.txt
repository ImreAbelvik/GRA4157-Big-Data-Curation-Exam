Nedre Vats, 11 September 2024: The remuneration committee, a subcommittee of the
board of directors of AutoStore Holdings Ltd. (the "Company" or "AutoStore",
OSE: AUTO), has, on 11 September 2024, approved new grants under the long-term
incentive plan for 2024 ("LTIP") for certain members of the Company's management
and other leading employees (the "Executives") in line with the terms as adopted
by the annual general meeting of the Company held on 19 May 2022. The LTIP was
first launched in 2022 and continued in 2023 and now in 2024. The LTIP is
designed to strengthen the Executives retention through the awarding of rolling
out annual LTIP grants.

Under the LTIP, the Executives are awarded a conditional grant of share options,
performance share units ("PSUs") and/or restricted stock units ("RSUs"). The
share options and RSUs are issued to focus the Executives on such activities
which promote share price appreciation. The PSUs are issued to provide a
mechanism to incentivize and reward the achievement of strategic goals, in
pursuit of sustainable value creation. The incentive vehicles therefore
encourage the LTIP participants to act in the best interests of the Company for
the benefit of shareholders and wider stakeholder groups.

The total number of options that will be awarded under the LTIP for 2024 is
2,632,927, where each option will give the holder the right to acquire one
AutoStore share from the Company. The options under the LTIP for 2024 shall vest
on 11 September 2027 and can be exercised within 36 months with a strike price
of NOK 13.4025 per option.

The total number PSUs that will be awarded under the LTIP for 2024 is 1,238,843.
Vesting of the PSUs is based on the achievement of financial or other
performance goals, and may only be vested by the holder upon approval of the
board of directors in their sole discretion. Once vested, each PSU will award
the holder with one AutoStore share.

The total number of RSUs that will be awarded under the LTIP for 2024 is
2,103,958. The RSUs are subject to a time based vesting and shall vest on the
date falling 36 months following the date of grant.

The primary insiders of the Company, Mats Hovland Vikse (CEO), Paul Harrison
(CFO), Anette Matre (Chief People & Information Officer), Israel Losada Salvador
(COO), Carlos Fernandez (CSO), Bendik Førre (CSO), Parth Joshi (CPO) and Jenny
Sveen Hovda (General Counsel) have been awarded a total of 2,632,927 options and
1,238,843 PSUs under the LTIP for 2024, in addition Michael Dickson (CRO), has
been awarded 66,759 RSUs, as further described in the attached forms.
