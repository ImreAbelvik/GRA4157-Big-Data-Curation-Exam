(Nedre Vats, 27 August 2025): Reference is made to the stock exchange
announcement published by AutoStore Holdings Ltd. ("AutoStore", OSE: AUTO) on 16
June 2025, where the result of the employee share purchase plan for 2025 (the
"2025 Program") for all permanent employees (the "Permanent Employees") of
AutoStore Holdings Ltd. and its subsidiaries (the "Group") was announced.

Permanent employees who did not participate during the initial application
period in June have now been extended an opportunity to apply during a second
application period, which commenced today, 27 August 2025, at 06:00 hours (CEST)
and expired at 16:30 hours (CEST). The relevant Permanent Employees were offered
to apply for shares in AutoStore for a minimum investment amount of NOK 1,000
and a maximum investment amount of NOK 1,000,000 on similar terms and conditions
as the Permanent Employees in June 2025. The shares purchased will be subject to
a two-year lock-up period.

The Permanent Employees have purchased a total of 506,974 shares in AutoStore by
the end of the application period.

For purchases made by primary insiders, please see the attached forms of
notification and public disclosure for further information.

AutoStore reserves the right to cancel purchases by any applicant if the
applicant fails to make timely payment for the shares to AutoStore. The shares
delivered to the applicants subject to timely payment, will be existing shares
held in treasury by AutoStore. The purchase price for each share under the 2025
Program in this second application period is NOK 6.4697, which is equal to the
volume-weighted average share price for AutoStore's shares on the Oslo Stock
Exchange during the 30 trading days prior to the offer (i.e. including 26 August
2025), with a reduction of 20% to compensate for the lock-up undertaking.

More information about the employee share purchase plan is included in the
remuneration guidelines approved at AutoStore's annual general meeting on 19 May
2022, available in the meeting notice published on 28 April 2022 via NewsWeb
(http://www.newsweb.oslobors.no).
