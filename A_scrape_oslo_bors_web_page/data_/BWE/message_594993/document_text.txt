Long-Term Incentive Program - new awards


The Board of Directors of BW Energy Limited ("BWE" or the "Company") approved
the award of share options under a Long-Term Incentive Program (LTIP) adopted on
19th May 2021 to align the interests of the participating employees with those
of the Company's shareholders. This year is the third annual award under the
LTIP. The LTIP is discretionary, and participants are invited on an annual
basis.


The total number of shares awarded under the LTIP for 2023 is 1,414,400,
allocated to options that will give the holder the right to acquire one BW
Energy share. A total of 19 BW Energy employees have been invited to participate
in the program.


The strike price of the options is calculated based on the volume-weighted
average share price five trading days prior to grant date, plus a premium of
15.76% (corresponding to a 5% increase annually over 3 years). The strike price
for the options awarded on 7 July 2023 is NOK 31,26.


The options will have a vesting period of three years, followed by a three-year
exercise period. Exercise windows will be set by the Company. The options will
expire 6 years after the award date.


The options are non-tradable and conditional upon the option holder being
employed by the Company and not having resigned or being terminated for cause
