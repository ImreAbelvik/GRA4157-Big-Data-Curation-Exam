Long-Term Incentive Program initiated

The  Board  of  Directors  of  BW  Energy  Limited  ("BWE" or the "Company") has
approved  the award of share options  under a Long-Term Incentive Program (LTIP)
adopted  on  19(th) May  2021, to  align  the  interests  of  the  participating
employees  with those  of the  Company's shareholders.  This is the first annual
award  under the LTIP. The LTIP is discretionary and participants are invited on
an annual basis.

The  total number of shares awarded under the LTIP for 2021 are 1,547,966, where
1,289,972 are  allocated  to  options  that  will  give  the holder the right to
acquire one BW Energy shares and 257,994 are allocated to Restricted Share Units
("RSUs")  providing the holder  shares at each  vesting event. A  total of 16 BW
Energy employees have been invited to participate in the program.

The  strike price  of the  options is  calculated based  on the  volume weighted
average  share price five  trading days prior  to grant date,  plus a premium of
15.76% (corresponding  to a 5% increase annually over 3 years). The strike price
for the options awarded on 7 July 2021 is NOK 30,73.

The options will have a vesting period of three years, followed by a three years
exercise  period. Exercise windows will be set  by the Company. The options will
expire 6 years after the award date.

The  RSUs are settled in shares  immediately following vesting schedule. At time
of  vesting the shares will  be settled at the  Fair Market Value. The RSUs will
vest 1/3 annually over three years.

The  options and  RSUs are  non-tradable and  conditional upon the option holder
being  employed by the Company  and not having resigned  or being terminated for
