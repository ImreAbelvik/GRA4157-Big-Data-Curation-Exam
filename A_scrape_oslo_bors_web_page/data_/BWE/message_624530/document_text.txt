BW Energy: Long-Term Incentive Program - new awards

The Board of Directors of BW Energy Limited ("BWE" or the "Company") approved
the award of share options under a Long-Term Incentive Program (LTIP) adopted on
19 May 2021 to align the interests of the participating employees with those of
the Company's shareholders. This year is the fourth annual award under the LTIP.
The LTIP is discretionary, and participants are invited on an annual basis.

allocated to options that will give the holder the right to acquire one BW
Energy share. A total of 10 BW Energy employees have been invited to participate

average share price five trading days prior to grant date, plus a premium of
15.75% (corresponding to a 5% increase annually over three years). The strike
price for the options awarded on 1 August 2024 is NOK 36,41.


The options will have a vesting period of three years, followed by a three-year
exercise period. Exercise windows will be set by the Company. The options will
expire six years after the award date.


The options are non-tradable and conditional upon the option holder being
employed by the Company and not having resigned or being terminated for cause
prior to the vesting date.
