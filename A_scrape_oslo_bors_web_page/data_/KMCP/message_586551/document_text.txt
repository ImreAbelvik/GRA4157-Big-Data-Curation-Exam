The Board of Directors of KMC Properties ASA ("KMCP", the "Company", OSE ticker code:"KMCP") has approved a long-term incentive plan ("LTIP 2023") aimed to align the interests of employees of the Company with those of the shareholders. 

Under LTIP 2023, employees of KMCP will be awarded share options and the Board of Directors has today resolved to award 3,238,936 share options under the plan (equivalent to 1,0% of the total number of shares in issue). Each option will give the holder the right to acquire one KMCP share from the Company. 

The exercise price for the KMCP Options is NOK 6.4571, which is equal to the volume weighted average trading price (VWAP) of KMCP´s shares on the Oslo Stock Exchange during the last 30 days before grant date, 29.03.2023.

The options will have a vesting period of three years from being awarded, whereby 20% of the options will vest after one year, 30% after two years and 50% will vest after three years, and may then be exercised in a period of two additional years. The options are non-tradable and conditional upon the option holder being employed by the Company or its subsidiaries and not having resigned or being terminated for cause prior to the vesting date.
