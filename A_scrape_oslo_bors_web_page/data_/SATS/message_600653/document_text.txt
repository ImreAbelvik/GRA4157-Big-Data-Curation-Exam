Reference is made to the stock exchange announcements dated October 1, 2020,
and December 22, 2020, published by SATS ASA (the "Company") in connection
with the additional investment by the CEO under the 2020 Share Investment
Program. In order to further align the interests of the Company's CEO with
those of the Company's shareholders, the board of directors resolved to expand
the 2020 Share Investment Program for Sondre Gravir (the "2020 Additional SIP
Investment"). Sondre Gravir acquired 97,330 shares in the 2020 Additional SIP
Investment (which represented a total value of NOK 1,750,000 and a
post-discount investment of NOK 1,400,000).

As part of the 2020 Additional SIP Investment, Sondre Gravir could be awarded
additional shares in the Company without consideration ("Matching Shares") in
the ratio 0.33:1 based on the number of shares acquired under the program,
subject to certain conditions being fulfilled.

The conditions for awarding Matching Shares have been fulfilled. The board of
directors has therefore, today, resolved to award 32,443 shares in the Company
to Sondre Gravir. The value per Matching Share is NOK 9.85, which represents
the trading price on Oslo Børs for the Company's shares at the close of
trading on September 29, 2023, including a 17.65% discount to reflect the
one-year lock-up obligation on said shares.

The award of Matching Shares will be settled with existing shares in the
Company, held in treasury. Prior to the award of the Matching Shares, the
Company owned 650,904 shares. Following the settlement of the award, the
Company will have 618,461 shares in treasury, representing approximately 0.30%
of the issued share capital.

Mira Investment AS, a close associate of primary insider Sondre Gravir (CEO),
has been awarded 32,443 Matching Shares in the Company. For more information,
see the attached form. This transaction is notifiable pursuant to Article 19
of the Market Abuse Regulation.
