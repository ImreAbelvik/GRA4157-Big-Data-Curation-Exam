Reference is made to the stock exchange announcement on 29 June 2020,
published by SATS ASA (the "Company") in connection with the share investment
program implemented in 2020 (the "2020 Share Investment Company").

As part of the 2020 Share Investment Program, certain senior executives and
other key employees (the "Participants"), could be rewarded additional shares
in the Company without consideration (the "Matching Shares") in the ratio
0.33:1 based on the number of shares originally acquired under the program,
subject to certain conditions being fulfilled.

The conditions for awarding Matching Shares have been fulfilled. The board of
directors has therefore today resolved to award a total of 475,159 shares to
15 Participants in the 2020 Share Investment Program.

The value of the Matching Shares is NOK 8.10 each, representing the trading
price of the Company's shares at the close of trading on June 30, 2023, with a
19% discount to reflect the one-year lock-up obligation.

The award of Matching shares is considered to be a benefit in kind, which is
subject to income tax for the Recipients. To cover certain Recipients' income
tax positions, the Company will withhold a number of Matching Shares
corresponding to their tax obligations. Consequently, the number of Matching
Shares to be delivered to the Participants will be reduced to a total of
38,799 Matching Shares.

The Company's obligation to award Matching Shares will be settled by existing
shares in the Company, held in treasury. Prior to the award of Matching
Shares, the Company owned 2,356,817 shares. Following the award, the Company
will have 1,920,457 shares in treasury, representing approximately 0.94% of
the issued share capital.

Company have been awarded Matching Shares. See details below and in the
