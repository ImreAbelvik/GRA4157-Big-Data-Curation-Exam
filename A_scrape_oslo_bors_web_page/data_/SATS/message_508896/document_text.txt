Reference is made to the stock exchange notice on 22 June 2020 published by SATS ASA (the "Company"), regarding the implementation of the Share Investment Program for employees and certain members of the board of directors. The Application Period expired today, on 29 June 2020 at 10:00 CEST.

A total of 204 employees have applied for a total of 1,770,636 new shares in the Company by the end of the Application Period. In accordance with the authorisation to increase the share capital by the issuance of new shares granted by the Company’s annual general meeting 26 May 2020, the board of directors have today resolved to increase the share capital in connection with the Company’s share investment program by minimum NOK 2,125,000 and maximum NOK 3,762,601.50 by the issuance of up to 1,770,636 new shares. All 1,770,636 new shares have been subscribed for by the employees and board members who have applied for shares in the Share Investment Program. The Company reserves the right to cancel subscriptions by any subscriber if the subscriber fails to make timely payment for the shares to the Company.

The offer price (before discount) for the new shares is NOK 18.66, which equals the volume weighted average share price for the Company's shares on the Oslo Stock Exchange during the 10 trading days prior to the expiry of the Application Period. The subscribers will receive a discount of 20% or 15% of the offer price, depending on the length of the lock-up period and the subscription prices for the new shares are hence NOK 14.93 and NOK 15.86, respectively.

As part of the Investment Program for the Executive Management and other management personnel, management employees may after the expiration of their respective lock-up period be awarded additional shares in the Company without consideration ("Matching Shares") in the ratio of 0.33:1 based on the number of shares originally acquired under the Share Investment Program, subject to certain conditions being fulfilled.
