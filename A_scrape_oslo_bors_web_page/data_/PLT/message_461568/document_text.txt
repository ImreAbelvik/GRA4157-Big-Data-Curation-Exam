Horten, 18 October 2018

The Board of Directors of poLight ASA ("poLight" or the "Company") has today
decided to offer the employees of the Company a possibility to exchange their
existing share options with new share options at a strike price corresponding to
the offer price in the Company's initial public offering. In addition, the Board
of Directors has decided to offer certain employees a limited number of
additional share options, mainly in order to replace options that had expired.

The offer is made to provide the Company's employees with new long-term
incentives in order to contribute to further growth for the Company, and the
strike price of the options has therefore been set to NOK 50 per option,
corresponding to the offer price in the Company's initial public offering. If
all employees accept the offer, the Company will issue 403,420 new share options
and existing share options that are exchanged will be cancelled without
compensation. Employees who do not accept the offer will keep their share
options in accordance with earlier awards.

The main terms of the new share options are as set out below:

-        Each share option gives the right to require issuance of one new share
in the Company;

-        The strike price for each option is NOK 50;

-        The options vest (becomes exercisable) in equal parts with 1/36 each
month over 3 years;

-        Vested options may be exercised during certain exercise periods to be
determined by the Board of Directors from time to time;

-        Any vested options that are not exercised during an exercise period
will be transferred to the subsequent exercise period; and

-        The options expire 5 years after their grant. Following such date, the
options are void and cancelled.

As of today, the following primary insiders have accepted the offer to exchange
their share options and holds share options as further described below:
