LINK Mobility Group Holding ASA (LINK) refers to the extraordinary general meeting (EGM) on 7 December 2021 where a share purchase program (ESPP) for employees was approved. LINK's board of directors’ authorization to increase the share capital of the company in relation to incentive schemes was renewed at the annual general meeting (AGM) held on 31 May 2022.

Under the terms of the ESPP, all employees were given the opportunity to apply for shares for up to a maximum amount of NOK 100,000. The program received strong interest and 588,127 shares were subscribed for. The shares are subject to a lock-up period of 12 months. Upon allocation, the subscription price of the shares was set to NOK 9.29, based on a valuation of NOK 11.61, which corresponds to the seven-day volume weighted average LINK share price (VWAP) prior to and including the final day of the subscription period, 27 May 2022, to which a 20 per cent discount was applied. As part of ESPP, employees may, after a vesting period of two years, receive 1 matching share (subject to payment of the nominal value per share only) per 3 shares subscribed for subject to certain conditions being fulfilled.
