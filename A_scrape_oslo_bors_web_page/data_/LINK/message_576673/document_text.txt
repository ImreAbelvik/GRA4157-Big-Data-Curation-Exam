LINK Mobility Group Holding ASA (LINK) refers to the extraordinary general meeting (EGM) on 7 December 2021 where a share purchase program (ESPP) for employees was approved. LINK's board of directors’ authorization to increase the share capital of the company in relation to incentive schemes was renewed at the annual general meeting (AGM) held on 31 May 2022.

Under the terms of the ESPP, all employees have been given the opportunity to apply for shares for up to a maximum amount of NOK 100,000. The program has received strong interest with 588,127 shares subscribed for in June 2022 (reference is made to announcement by LINK on 3 June 2022) and an additional 131,972 shares subscribed for now in November 2022. The shares are subject to a lock-up period of 12 months. Upon allocation, the subscription price of the shares in November 2022 was set to NOK 6.954, based on a valuation of NOK 8.692, which corresponds to the seven-day volume weighted average LINK share price (VWAP) prior to the final day of the subscription period, 20 November 2022, to which a 20 per cent discount was applied. As part of ESPP, employees may, after a vesting period of two years, receive 1 matching share (subject to payment of the nominal value per share only) per 3 shares subscribed for subject to certain conditions being fulfilled.

Based on the subscription for shares by employees, the board has today resolved to increase the company's share capital with NOK 659.86 from NOK 1,478,849.19 to NOK 1,479,509.05 by issuing 131,972 new shares at a subscription price of NOK 6.954 per share, each with a nominal value of NOK 0.005. 

Following registration of the share capital increase with the Norwegian Register of Business Enterprises, the company will have a share capital of NOK 1,479,509.05, divided into 295,901,810 shares, each with a nominal value of NOK 0.005.
