Following the exercise of warrants, Mr. Maier, including closely associated companies, holds no outstanding warrants in DVD.

Pursuant to the warrant exercises, the Company's share capital will be increased by NOK 90,000 through the issuance of 900,000 new shares, each with a par value of NOK 0.10. Upon registration of the share capital increase, the Company's share capital will be NOK 9,152,500 divided into 91,525,000 shares, each with a par value of NOK 0.10.
