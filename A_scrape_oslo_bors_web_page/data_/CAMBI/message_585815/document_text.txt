Asker, Norway, 21 March 2023
Cambi ASA has established a share-based incentive program (“Restricted Share Unit Plan”, RSUP) for key personnel to encourage employees to maintain a deep, long-term engagement in the company by further aligning the employees' interests with those of other shareholders. The RSUP also enhances Cambi’s ability to attract and retain employees.

On 21 March 2023, the purchase of Restricted Share Units (“RSUs”) by key personnel in Cambi ASA was recorded as follows:

The purchased RSUs will vest on the following deadlines:
•	For 1/3 of the shares on 12 January 2025.
•	For 1/3 of the shares on 12 January 2026.
•	For 1/3 of the shares on 12 January 2027. 

The RSUs were purchased from Cambi at a price per share of NOK 6.04, determined based on the volume-weighted average listed price of CAMBI shares during the five-day period ending on 20 March 2023, less a 20% discount to cater for value-reducing terms associated with the RSUs (including a vesting period).  

On 20 December 2022, the Cambi ASA Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) passed a resolution authorising the Board of Directors to provide financial assistance through loans to the employees in connection with the RSU purchases. The total loan amount granted from Cambi under the RSPU is NOK 7,537,745.

Following the purchase of 100,000 RSUs by key personnel, Cambi ASA owns 5,608 of its own shares.
