Reference is made to the general meeting on 24 April 2025, where a resolution was passed that as part of the renumeration for the shareholder-elected board members, the board members can opt to receive part of their renumeration as shares in Goodtech. The share-based part of the compensation, should they opt to receive this, is NOK 82,500 for the chairman of the board, and NOK 41,250 for board members.

Four shareholder-elected board members and primary insiders have opted to receive shares as part of their renumeration. The shares are allocated to the board members at market price, which is calculated based on the 10-day volume-weighted average prior to the 2025 Annual General Meeting, with a reduction corresponding to the value of the hold-up period of one year. The shares have been allocated at a share price of NOK 7.448. The allocation of shares to the primary insiders are as follows:

•	Mimi Berdal (Chairman of the board): 11,076 shares
•	Rachid Bendriss (Board member): 5,538 shares
•	Åge Westbø: 5,538 shares
•	Frode Haugli: 5,538 shares
