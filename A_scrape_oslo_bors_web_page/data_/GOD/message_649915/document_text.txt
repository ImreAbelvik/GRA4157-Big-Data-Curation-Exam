Award of new RSUs
Reference is made to the Annual General Meeting on 24 April 2025, where a new annual RSU allocation program ("RSU 2") was implemented for those employees that rolled off the existing share-based incentive program ("RSU 1") initiated in June 2022. The new RSU 2 program entitles select Leading Employees to receive RSUs with a three-year vesting period. Eligibility depends on retaining Restricted Shares acquired under RSU 1 and continued employment by the company. Participants who divest any RSU 1 Restricted Shares will no longer qualify for future RSU 2 allocations.

For the year 2025, the Board of Directors has awarded 99,900 RSUs to Leading Employees of the Company. Of the 99,900 RSUs, the primary insiders were awarded the following:

•	Margrethe Hauge, Chief Executive Officer, has received 25,000 RSUs.
•	Magne Reierson, Chief Operating Officer, has received 16,700 RSUs.
•	Erling Gresvoll Olsen, Chief Sales Officer, has received 16,700 RSUs.

Exercise of existing RSUs - settlement and Mandatory Notification of Trades
Under the Company's share-based incentive program RSU 1, investments made by Leading Employees are to be matched by Goodtech ASA based on a multiple of the initial number of invested shares following a three-year vesting period. On 24 June 2025, 512,302 Matching Shares from the prior years' awards have vested and automatically exercised. In accordance with the terms and conditions of the RSU Matching Program, a total of 512,302 shares will be transferred to employees from the treasury shares acquired by the Company under its share buy-back program completed in 2022.

Following the transfer of shares to settle the Matching share obligation, the Company's registered share capital remains unchanged at NOK 59,257,742, divided into 29,628,871 shares, each having a face value of NOK 2.0. 

The total settlement of shares to primary insiders is as follows: 
• Margrethe Hauge, Chief Executive Officer, has received 199,599 Matching Shares. Following this, Mrs. Hauge controls 359,865 shares in the Company's share capital and holds 25,000 RSUs.

Following this settlement and award of new RSUs, the Company will have a total of 488,990 outstanding Matching shares and RSUs. Subject to fulfilling the vesting conditions, each RSU and Matching share entitles the holder to one share in the Company.
