Yara has today purchased in the market a total of 19,261 Yara shares (ticker:
YAR, ISIN: NO0010208051) at an average price of NOK 297.8423 per share on behalf
of members of Yara's Group Executive Board. The shares are purchased on behalf
of and transferred to Yara executives taking part in the Share Based
Remuneration (SBR) program.

In order to support alignment between members of the Group Executive Board and
shareholder interests, it is expected that members of the Group Executive Board
participating in Yara's Share Based Remuneration program (SBR), in addition to
the shares received as part of the SBR, invest in Yara shares an amount
equalling the lowest amount received as net, after tax short-term incentive plan
payout for the preceding year or the net amount received as SBR for the relevant
year, and do so yearly as a minimum. Such investments should be made until the
shareholding amounts to the member's gross remuneration package, including
pensions. Furthermore, it is also expected that members of the Group Executive
Board do not sell any Yara shares as long as they are members of the Group
Executive Board.

Yara has in addition purchased residual shares from the Share Based Remuneration
allocation performed in February 2024.

Guidelines on salary and other remuneration for executive personnel are further
described in the Yara Integrated Report 2023 on pages 67-71.
