27.10.2015: Borregaard ASA ("Borregaard", OSE ticker: BRG)

Borregaard's Board of Directors has decided to issue 500,000 share options in
accordance with the proxy given by the Annual General Meeting held on 15 April
2015.

The options will expire after five years (27 October 2020), and may be exercised
in the last two years. The strike price of the options is NOK 51.49. It is based
on the volume weighted average share price during the first three trading days
after the announcement of the 3(rd) quarter results, with an addition of 10%.
The strike price will be adjusted for dividend and equity transactions. The
maximum annual gain is limited to twice the annual base salary for the CEO, and
equivalent to the annual base salary for the other option holders. At least 50%
of the proceeds after tax must be used to purchase shares in the Company, and
the purchased shares will be locked for a period of three years. In addition,
the members of the Executive Management are expected to acquire shares until
their shareholdings equal their annual base salary, and twice the base salary
for the CEO.
