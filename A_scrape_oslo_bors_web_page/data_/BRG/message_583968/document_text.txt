Borregaard's Board of Directors has issued share options in accordance with the
proxy given by the Annual General Meeting held on 7 April 2022. The total number
of options issued is 250,000.

The options will expire after five years (1 March 2028) and may be exercised in
the last two years. The strike price of the options is NOK 194.00. It is based
on the volume weighted average share price (VWAP) during the first three trading

10%. The strike price will be adjusted for dividend and other equity
transactions. The maximum annual gain is limited to twice the annual base salary

for the other option holders. At least 50% of the proceeds after tax must be
used to purchase shares in the company, and the purchased shares will be locked
for a period of three years. The members of the executive management are
expected to acquire shares until their shareholdings equal their annual base
salary, and twice the base salary for the Chief Executive Officer.
