06.02.2019: Borregaard ASA ("Borregaard", OSE ticker: BRG)

Borregaard's Board of Directors has decided to issue share options in accordance
with the proxy given by the Annual General Meeting held on 12 April 2018. The
total number of options issued is 400,000.

The options will expire after five years (6 February 2024), and may be exercised
in the last two years. The strike price of the options is NOK 82.35. It is based
on the volume weighted average share price during the first three trading days
after the announcement of the 4(th) quarter 2018 results with an addition of
10%. The strike price will be adjusted for dividend and equity transactions. The
maximum annual gain is limited to twice the annual base salary for the CEO, and
equivalent to the annual base salary for the other option holders. At least 50%
of the proceeds after tax must be used to purchase shares in the Company, and
the purchased shares will be locked for a period of three years. The members of
the Executive Management are expected to acquire shares until their
shareholdings equal their annual base salary, and twice the base salary for the
CEO.
