Borregaard's Board of Directors has decided to issue share options in accordance
with the proxy given by the Annual General Meeting held on 13 April 2016. The
total number of options issued is 364,000.

The options will expire after five years (17 February 2022), and may be
exercised in the last two years. The strike price of the options is NOK 104.11.
It is based on the volume weighted average share price during the first three
trading days after the announcement of the 4(th) quarter 2016 results with an
addition of 10%. The strike price will be adjusted for dividend and equity
transactions. The maximum annual gain is limited to twice the annual base salary

holders. At least 50% of the proceeds after tax must be used to purchase shares
in the Company, and the purchased shares will be locked for a period of three
years. In addition, the members of the Executive Management are expected to
acquire shares until their shareholdings equal their annual base salary, and
twice the base salary for the CEO.
