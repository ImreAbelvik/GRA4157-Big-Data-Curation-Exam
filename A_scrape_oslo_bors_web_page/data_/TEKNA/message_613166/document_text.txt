On March 11th 2024, the Board of Directors of Tekna Holding ASA (the "Company")
has resolved to increase the Company's share capital by NOK 4 469 774 by issuing
2 234 887 new shares as part the settlement of the Company's employee share
purchase plan (the "ESPP"). Under the ESPP, which was established on 18 February
2021, certain qualified employees purchased Class B Common shares in Tekna
Holding Canada Inc ("Tekna Holding Canada"). Pursuant to the terms of the ESPP,
there was a three-year lock-up period on these shares. The three-year lock-up
period expired on 18 February 2024 and the ESPP has been settled by way of the
employees transferring the Class B Common shares in Tekna Holding Canada to
Tekna Holding ASA in exchange for the issuance of new shares in Tekna Holding
ASA. Following this transaction, Tekna Holding Canada is a wholly owned
subsidiary of Tekna Holding ASA.

Following the registration of the share capital increase with the Norwegian
Register of Business Enterprises, the Company's share capital will be NOK 254
924 466 divided into 127 462 233 Shares, each with a nominal value of NOK 2.
Each share carries one vote at the Company's general meeting. The new shares
shall carry rights to dividends from the date on which the capital increase is
registered with the Norwegian Register of Business Enterprises.

The settlement of the ESPP will trigger tax for the relevant employees. To
provide the employees with cash to cover payable taxes resulting from the
settlement of the ESPP, Arendals Fossekompani ASA ("AFK") has agreed to purchase
a total of 540 812 shares from the employees at the volume weighted average
market price the last five days prior to the expiration of the lock-up period,
NOK 8,0453 per share.
