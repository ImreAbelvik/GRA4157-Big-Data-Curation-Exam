9.12.2024 21:00:01 CET | Tekna Holding ASA | Mandatory notification of trade
primary insiders

The board of directors of Tekna Holding ASA (the "Company") has resolved to
implement an employee share option plan (the "Plan"). The Plan is available to
eligible individuals as determined by the board of directors. The Plan enables
the eligible person to acquire a proprietary interest in the growth and
performance of the Company and to enhance the ability of the Company to attract,
retain and reward qualified individuals. Options can be granted on an annual or
ad hoc basis, with annual grants projected for 2024, 2025, and 2026, all subject
to the board's discretion. Upon exercising their options, option holders can
choose between acquiring shares after paying the strike price or opting for a
cashless transaction. The latter involves the transfer of a number of treasury
shares equivalent to the NOK amount of the number of exercised options,
multiplied by the difference between the Company's shares' market price and the
strike price.

On 23 October 2024, the board of directors has granted a total of 2,124,000
options in the 2024 allocation round. These options have a strike price of NOK
4.88. Issued options vest 33% after one year, 33% after two years, and 33% after
three years. The expiry date for any option granted is the date falling 24
months following the vesting date.

· Luc Dionne (CEO): 319 000 options. Following the grant, he holds a total of
319 000 options (shareholding: 338 164 shares privately).
