new USD senior secured bond issue with a 5 year tenor may follow, subject to
inter alia market conditions. Proceeds from the potential bond issue would
mainly be applied for a refinancing of the company's bonds maturing in November
2020 with ticker OKEA01 and ISIN NO0010810062. In conjunction with the potential
bond issue, the company may offer a conditional buy-back of OKEA01, after which
remaining OKEA01 bonds would be called.
