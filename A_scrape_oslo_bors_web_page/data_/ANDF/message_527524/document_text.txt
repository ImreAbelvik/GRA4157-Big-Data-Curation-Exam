About Andfjord Salmon AS

Andfjord Salmon has developed an innovative and sustainable aquaculture concept
for shore-based farming of Atlantic salmon. The company's ambition is to build
the world's most sustainable aquaculture facility of its kind. The facility is
escape-proof, lice-free and its highly filtered effluent avoids polluting marine
life. 

Located at Kvalnes on the island of Andøya on the Arctic Archipelago of
Vesterålen, Norway, the company's first facility is currently under
construction. The company holds a license to produce 12 600 tonnes (HOG) for
land-based farming of Atlantic salmon and has secured rights to land for a
planned expansion of an additional 77,400 tonnes (HOG) production capacity.
Further expansion is subject to the zoning of the land and granting of licenses.
