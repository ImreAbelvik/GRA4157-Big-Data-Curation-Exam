ABOUT ANDFJORD SALMON

About Andfjord Salmon AS

Andfjord Salmon has developed an innovative and sustainable aquaculture concept
for shore-based farming of Atlantic salmon, based on a flow-through farming
concept. The company's ambition is to build the world's most sustainable
aquaculture facility of its kind. The facility is escape-proof, lice-free and
its highly filtered effluent avoids polluting marine life. 

Located at Kvalnes on the island of Andøya on the Arctic Archipelago of
Vesterålen, Norway, the company's first facility is currently under
construction. The company holds a license to produce 12 600 tonnes (HOG) for
land-based farming of Atlantic salmon and has secured rights to land for a
planned expansion of an additional 77,400 tonnes (HOG) production capacity.
Further expansion is subject to the zoning of the land and granting of licenses. 

Andfjord Salmon AS is listed on Euronext Growth under the ticker ANDF.
