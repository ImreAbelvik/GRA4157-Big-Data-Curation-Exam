About Andfjord Salmon™ 
Andfjord Salmon™ has developed an innovative and sustainable aquaculture concept for land-based farming of Atlantic Salmon. The company’s ambition is to build the world’s most sustainable aquaculture facility of its kind. The facility is escape-proof, lice-free and its highly filtered effluent avoids polluting marine life. Additionally, the facility will be partly powered by the use of solar panels and wind turbines. 

Located at Kvalnes on the island Andøya on the Arctic Archipelago of Vesterålen, Norway, the company’s first facility is currently under construction. The company holds a license for 10,000 tons Maximum Allowed Biomass (MAB) for land-based flow-through farming of Atlantic salmon. The company has secured rights to properties for a potential expansion of an additional 60,000 tonnes MAB licensed capacity. This is estimated to result in 90 000 tons of production capacity on Andøya per year. The further expansion is subject to the zoning of the land and granting of licenses. Andfjord Salmon AS is listed on the Stock Exchange Euronext Growth Oslo under the ticker ANDF.
