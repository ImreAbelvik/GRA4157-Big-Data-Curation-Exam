expression "Prospectus Directive" means Directive 2003/71/EC (as 
amended, including by Directive 2010/73/EU), and includes any 
relevant implementing measure in each Relevant Member State. A 
Prospectus prepared pursuant to the Prospectus Directive and 
approved by the competent authority in Norway is expected to be 
published by the Bank before the Offering period commences (if ever 
commenced) and, when and if published, can be obtained on the 
Bank's website, subject to regulatory restrictions. Investors

be placed for any purpose on the information contained in this 
announcement or its accuracy or completeness. This announcement

with, any contract therefor. In any EEA Member State other than

communication is only addressed to and is only directed at
qualified investors in that Member State within the meaning of the 
Prospectus Directive.

Matters discussed in this announcement may constitute forward-
looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements that 
are not historical facts and may be identified by words such 
as "believe", "expect", "anticipate", "strategy", "intends", 
"estimate", "will", "may", "continue", "should" and similar 
expressions. The forward-looking statements in this release are 
based upon various assumptions, many of which are based, in turn, 
upon further assumptions. Although the Bank believes that these 
assumptions were reasonable when made, these assumptions are 
inherently subject to significant known and unknown risks, 
uncertainties, contingencies and other important factors which are 
difficult or impossible to predict and are beyond its control. Such 
risks, uncertainties, contingencies and other important factors 
could cause actual events to differ materially from the 
expectations expressed or implied in this release by such forward-
looking statements. 

The information, opinions and forward-looking statements contained 
in this announcement speak only as at its date, and are subject to 
change without notice. Each of the Bank, the Joint Bookrunners and 
their respective affiliates expressly disclaim any obligation or 
undertaking to update, review or revise any forward-looking 
statement contained in this announcement whether as a result of new 
information, future developments or otherwise.

This announcement does not constitute a recommendation concerning 
any offer of securities. The price and value of securities and any 
income from them can go down as well as up. Past performance is not 
a guide to future performance. Information in this announcement or 
any of the documents relating to the IPO cannot be relied upon as a 
guide to future performance. There is no guarantee that the listing 
on Oslo Børs will occur and you should not base your financial 
decisions on the Bank's intentions in relation to the listing at 
this stage. Potential investors should consult a professional 
advisor as to the suitability of the IPO for the entity concerned. 
The Joint Bookrunners and their respective affiliates are acting 
exclusively for the Bank and no one else in connection with the
IPO. 

In connection with the IPO, the Joint Bookrunners and any of their 
affiliates, may take up a portion of the ECCs in the IPO as a 
principal position and in that capacity may retain, purchase, sell, 
offer to sell for their own accounts such securities and other 
securities of the Bank or related investments in connection with 
the IPO or otherwise.  Accordingly, references in the Prospectus, 
once published (if published), to the securities being issued, 
offered, subscribed, acquired, placed or otherwise dealt in should 
be read as including any issue or offer to, or subscription, 
acquisition, placing or dealing by, the Joint Bookrunners and any 
of their affiliates acting as investors for their own accounts. The 
Joint Bookrunners do not intend to disclose the extent of any such 
investment or transactions otherwise than in accordance with any 
legal or regulatory obligations to do so.

None of the Joint Bookrunners or any of their respective affiliates 
or any of their respective directors, officers, employees, advisors 
or agents accepts any responsibility or liability whatsoever for, 
or makes any representation or warranty, express or implied, as to 
the truth, accuracy or completeness of the information in this 
announcement (or whether any information has been omitted from the 
announcement) or any other information relating to the Bank, its 
subsidiaries or associated companies, whether written, oral or in a
