All allocations of options have been done in accordance with the share option plan, which allows for an employee to opt for receiving options at market price instead of parts of his/her remuneration. The option value is established based on full market value calculated using observed trading prices and Black and Scholes's option pricing model, including an element of social security tax. As the social security tax rate in Sweden is higher, option value is different between primary insiders. Each option is issued with Komplett Bank ASA as issuer and provides the holder with a right to subscribe one share. The options are subject to a five years exercise period.
