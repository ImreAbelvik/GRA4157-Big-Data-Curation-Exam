The board of directors of AKVA group ASA ("AKVA group" or the "Company") has
decided to launch a share incentive program (the "Share Incentive Program") for
certain eligible employees of the Company and its subsidiaries.
The intention of the Share Incentive Program is to give employees an opportunity
to  buy  shares  in  the  Company  at  a discounted price. The shares offered to
employees  are existing  shares in  AKVA group  which have  been acquired in the
market  in accordance with a share buy-back program initiated by AKVA group, and
which are offered to employees under an exemption from the obligation to prepare
an  offering  prospectus  set  out  in  section  7-4 (1)  no. 9 of the Norwegian
Securities Trading Act. No prospectus will accordingly be prepared in connection
with the Share Incentive Program.
The  employees eligible  for participation  in the  Share Incentive Program must
confirm  their  participation  in  the  program  in  the period commencing on 1
December 2015 and ending on 14 December 2015 at 12:00 hours CET. The shares will
be allocated to such employees in January 2016.
Overview  of  terms  and  conditions  for  participation  in the Share Incentive
Program:
  * The Share Incentive Program is limited to employees of the Company and its
    subsidiaries with permanent employment contracts at commencement of the
    Share Incentive Program  ("Eligible Employees")

  * The share price offered to Eligible Employees will be NOK 27,09, which is
    the average price the Company has paid for shares acquired up to 27 November
    2015 through the share buyback program initiated on 10 September 2015 (the
    "Share Buyback Program"), NOK 33,86 per share, minus a discount of 20 per
    cent

  * Eligible Employees will be able to buy shares for NOK 5 000, NOK 10 000, NOK
    15 000, NOK 20 000, NOK 25 000 or NOK 30 000.

  * There will be an option for Eligible Employees to pay for purchased shares
    through a one-time deduction in salary payment in January 2016 or by monthly
    deductions in salary over 12 months starting in January 2016

  * To the extent Eligible Employees choose to pay in monthly instalments
    through a deduction from the salary, participation in the Share Incentive
    Program will be limited to an amount less than or equal to 2 months of net
    salary payment (salary after tax) for such Eligible Employees. In the event
    Eligible Employees seize to be employed or are subject to time limited lay
    off without having settled all outstanding instalments, the remaining
    instalments will be deducted from the salary as part of the final wage
    settlement.

  * Eligible Employees participating in the Share Incentive Program will be
    responsible for and have to cover their own personal tax cost related to
    receiving discounted shares from their employer. The tax treatment on a
    personal level varies from country to country. Their employer may, depending
    on local law and regulations, have to implement payroll withholding on the
    benefit earned by Eligible Employees, as well as comply with any tax
    reporting requirements.

  * If the Company is not able to buy a sufficient number of shares in the
    market through the Share Buyback Program to deliver all shares ordered by
    Eligible Employees, then the number of shares allocated to participating
    Eligible Employees will be reduced on a pro rata basis. For illustrative
    purposes: if the Company is only able to buy 90 per cent of the required
    shares in the market, then each participating Eligible Employees will be
    allocated  only 90 per cent of the number of shares requested.

Timetable:
  * Eligible Employees must confirm their participation in the Share Incentive
    Program in the period commencing on 1 December 2015 and ending on 14
    December 2015 at 12:00 hours CET

  * Participating Eligible Employees will be notified regarding the amount of
    shares they will be allocated before year end 2015

  * Shares will be delivered to participating Eligible Employees in January 2016
