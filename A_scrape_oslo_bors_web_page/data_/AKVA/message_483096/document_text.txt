In a notice to Oslo Stock Exchange as of August 16(th), AKVA group announced the
appointment of Mr Knut Nesse as new Chairperson.

Nesse & CO AS, a company controlled by Knut Nesse, has today acquired 50,000
shares from AKVA group (treasury shares) at a price of NOK 75.60 per share. Knut
Nesse / Nesse & CO AS owned nil shares in AKVA group prior to the acquisition.

Further, AKVA group and Knut Nesse have entered into an option agreement which
gives Knut Nesse the right to acquire further 50,000 shares at the same price.
The option agreement is subject to the general meeting's approval. The options
can be exercised in the period from April 1(st), 2022 to August 31(st), 2022,
conditional on Nesse still being a member of the board or employed in AKVA group
or in one of its subsidiaries. The options can also be exercised prior to the
said period if a takeover offer is made and completed, resulting in a change of
control in the company. The company can settle the options by issuing new
shares, deliver own shares (treasury shares ) or paying cash compensation equal
to the difference between the strike price and the market price for the
company's shares at the time of exercise.

The board of AKVA group recognizes that the agreement is not in line with the
recommendation in the Norwegian Code of Practice, which is also reflected in
AKVA group's statement of Corporate Governance, that board members should not be
granted share options. However, the board believes that it would be in the best
interest of the company and its shareholders to accept the non-compliance in
order to secure the appointment of an experienced chairperson with long and
broad industry knowledge and international experience.
