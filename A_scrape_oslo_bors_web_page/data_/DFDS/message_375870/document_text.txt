DFDS is launching a share buy-back programme on 22 April 2015 for an amount of
up to DKK 300m according to company announcement no. 33/2015 of 21 April 2015. 

The Lauritzen Foundation has committed itself to participating pro rata in the

participation in the previous share buy-back programme, ref. company
announcement no. 65/2014, to ensure an unchanged free float percentage

calculated accord-ing to the volume-weighted average purchase price for the
shares bought according to the share buy-back programme on the relevant day of
trading. 

When the share buy-back programme is completed, a company announcement will be
issued reporting the total number and value of shares sold by the Lauritzen

Trading Act will on an ongoing basis be sent to the Danish FSA.
