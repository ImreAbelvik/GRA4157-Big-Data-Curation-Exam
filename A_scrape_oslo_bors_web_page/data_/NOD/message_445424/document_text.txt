With reference to the Annual General Meeting on April 24th, 2017, Nordic Semiconductor has on the 27th February 2018 granted 1,477,400 share options to employees and primary insiders. On the AGM the Company was given the approval to issue up to 1.7 million options in 2018, equivalent to approximately 1% of the outstanding share capital in options to all employees.

According to the approval, the option scheme has a long term element as options are exercisable over a three-year period and expire after five years.  The options were granted at a strike price of NOK 47,27 (10% above volume weighted average share price the week following Q4 2017 results). If the company's share price exceeds a cap of NOK 141.81, the company may settle the option grant by compensating the employee the difference between the cap and the strike price.
