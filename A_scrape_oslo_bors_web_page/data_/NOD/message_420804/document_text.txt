On February 17th 2017, all options granted under the 2014 
option program expired and where deleted, in total 3,730,702 
outstanding options. 

With reference to the Annual General Meeting on April 19th, 
2016, Nordic Semiconductor has on the 22nd February 2017 
granted 1,625,412 share options to employees and primary 
insiders. On the AGM the Company was given the approval to 
issue up to 1.7 million options in 2017, equivalent to 
approximately 1% of the outstanding share capital in options 
to all employees. 

According to the approval, the option scheme has a long term 
element as options are exercisable over a three-year period 
and expire after five years.  The options were granted at a 
strike price of NOK 35,77 (10% above volume weighted average 
share price the week following Q4 2016 results).  If the 
company's share price exceeds a cap of NOK 107.31, the 
company may settle the option grant by compensating the 
employee the difference between the cap and the strike 
price. 


Please refer to the minutes of the December 8th, 2015 EGM 
for further details of the option plan.
