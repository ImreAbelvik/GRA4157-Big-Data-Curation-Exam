(Oslo, January 5, 2024) Grant of Restricted Stock Units and Performance Shares 

On April 20th, 2023 The Annual General Meeting of Nordic Semiconductor ASA approved the issue Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) and Performance Shares (PSUs) of an aggregate nominal value of up to 1% of the company’s outstanding share capital. 

Vegard Wollan, newly appointed CEO, has today been granted a total of 11,240 RSUs and 11,240 performance shares in the company. The granted number of RSUs and PSUs is based on 60% of Vegard’s base salary of NOK 4,250,000. As basis for the calculation, a volume-weighted average share price on December 11, 2023 (i.e. the date of appointment of Vegard Wollan as new CEO), of NOK 113.4 has been used. 

The RSUs will vest in July 2026 and the shares will be delivered to the employee at the vesting date against payment of the par value of the share (subject to the employee's continued employment with the Company). The shares may be newly issued shares or existing treasury shares. 

The PSUs are issued conditional upon the achievement of a certain set of objectives. The PSUs vest and will be delivered at par value upon the completion of the performance period, which is until July 2026. If the executive achieves at least 80% of the set performance targets, 50% of the shares will be granted, whilst on 120% achievement of targets a maximum two times the shares will be granted. As such, if maximum performance is achieved on the PSUs, a total of 22,480 shares will be delivered to the CEO. If less than 80% performance is achieved, zero shares will be delivered.

For further details on the program, please refer to the Guidelines for Executive Compensation that was approved by the Annual General Meeting.
