NOD: Exercise of employee share options, performance shares & restricted share units 

On April 29, 2022, employees in Nordic Semiconductor ASA have exercised 544,498 options, 111,626 performance shares (“PSUs”) and 492,780 restricted share units (“RSUs”) in Nordic Semiconductor ASA.  

The options contracts were granted to employees in 2019 with a "cap" of three times strike price. Upon exercise, the company has the right to settle its option contracts in cash by paying the difference between the share price and the strike price, with a maximum settlement fee equal to the difference between the "cap" and the strike price. Based on the current share price, the Board has authorized the company to exercise its right to settle its options contracts in cash by paying the difference between the "cap" and the strike price for outstanding 2019 options vesting in first half 2022, which have all reached cap. This option settlement will result in a cash payment of NOK 43,759,926 (~USD 4.7 million). There are no more outstanding options after this exercise. 

The vested PSUs were granted to the executive management team May 3, 2019, as part of the long-term incentive program approved by the Annual general meeting held on April 24th, 2019. The performance shares were issued conditional upon the achievement of a certain set of objectives. At the end of the performance period, all performance KPIs have been achieved and the max threshold of two times the numbers of shares was met. The Board of Directors has authorized the use of treasury shares to settle the vested shares.
