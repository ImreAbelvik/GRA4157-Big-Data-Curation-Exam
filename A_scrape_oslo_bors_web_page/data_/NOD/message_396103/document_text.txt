With reference to the Extraordinary General Meeting on 
December 8th 2015, Nordic Semiconductor has on the 
26th February 2016 granted 1,590,000 share options to 
employees and primary insiders. On the EGM the Company 
was given the approval to issue up to 1% of the 
outstanding share capital in options to all employees. 

According to the approval, the option scheme has a 
long term element as options are exercisable over a 
three-year period and expire after five years.  The 
options were granted at a strike price of NOK 47,72 
(10% above volume weighted average share price the 
week following Q4 2015 results).  If the company's 
share price exceeds a cap of NOK 143.16, the company 
may settle the option grant by compensating the 
employee the difference between the cap and the strike 
price. 

Please refer to the minutes of the December 8th, 2015 
EGM for further details of the option plan.
