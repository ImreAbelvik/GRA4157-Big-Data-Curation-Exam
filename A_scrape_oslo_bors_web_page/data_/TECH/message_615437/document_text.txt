The Board of Directors of Techstep ASA has resolved to grant share options in
connection with the company's 2024 share option programme.

To incentivise and retain key personnel, the option programme for 2024 will
include several key employees in addition to management. In total 1,800,000
share options have been granted, of which 990,000 to primary insiders,
distributed as follows:

  · Morten Meier, CEO, has been granted 350,000 share options and following this
grant has a holding of a total of 350,000 share options

164,065 share options
  · Sheena Lim, Chief Marketing Officer, has been granted 80,000 share options
and following this grant has a holding of a total of 164,065 share options

Each share option, when exercised, gives the right to purchase one share in
Techstep ASA.

The share options will become exercisable (vest) with 1/3 yearly after the grant
date and must be exercised within five years from the grant date.

The strike price per share is NOK 8.75 (year 1), NOK 10.90 (year 2) and NOK
13.60 (year 3), respectively.

The terms of the 2024 share options programme were decided by the Board in
February 2024, but execution of the programme and formal allocation of grants
was postponed due to practical reasons. The grants are conditional and subject
to appropriate resolutions being approved by the Annual General Meeting to be
held on 27 May 2024.
