acceptances for in total 16,089 shares under the 
Offer. 

Including the 62,689,859 shares already held by Zono

Techstep, representing 61.19 % of the shares and the 
votes in the company. 

These reported numbers of acceptances could be subject

yet been fully completed.

In the sake of good order, Zono Holding takes the 
opportunity to repeat that the purpose with the Offer 
solely is to comply with the mandatory offer 
obligations in the Securities Trading Act Norwegian, 
not to increase its ownership stake in Techstep.

requirements in section 4-2 of the Norwegian 
Securities Trading Act. Kristian G. Lundkvist, who is 
a member of the board of directors of Techstep, is
