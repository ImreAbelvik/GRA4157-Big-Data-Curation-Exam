Reference is made to the stock exchange notices on 24 
February and 10 March 2016 regarding the share consolidation 
in Birdstep Technology ASA ("BIRD" or the "Company").

The 29 January 2016 Extraordinary General Meeting, as 
previously announced, resolved a share consolidation, so 
that ten (10) shares, each having a par value of NOK 0.10, 
are consolidated into one (1) share having a par value of 
NOK 1.00. In this regard, it was communicated that 
shareholders who do not own a number of shares that is 
dividable by ten (10) will be rounded upwards, free of 
charge, so that they have a number of shares dividable by 
ten (10), by way of a transfer of shares from one or more of 
BIRD's existing shareholders and/ or BIRD's holding of own 
shares. 

The Board of Directors of BIRD has resolved to use a portion 
of BIRD's holding of own shares to round up existing 
shareholder's number of shares in connection with the 
implementation of the share consolidation, effective as of 
today. 

This information is subject of the disclosure requirements 
pursuant to Chapter 4 of the Norwegian Securities Trading 
Act.
