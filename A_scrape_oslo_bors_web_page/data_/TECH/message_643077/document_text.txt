The Board of Directors of Techstep ASA has resolved to grant share options in
connection with the company's 2025 share option programme. The 2025 share option
program comprise a total of 1,360,000 share options and are being granted based
on the same terms and conditions as previous programs, inter alia with the share
options vesting over a period of three years with 1/3 each year and with an
expiry date of 5 years from the grant date.

The strike price for the 2025 share options is based on the 30-day VWAP before 1
April 2025 with an addition of 10% and with an additional increase of 10% per
year thereafter as follows:

- Tranche 1: NOK 13.17

- Tranche 2: NOK 14.49

- Tranche 3: NOK 15.94

The board note that this year's program is more extensive than what should be
expected going forward, as the board deems it important to incentivise and
retain key personnel during the current phase of the company as part of the
ongoing strategic and operational turn-around.

Of the total 1,360,000 share options granted under the 2025 share option
program, a total of 790,000 share options have been granted to primary insiders
as follows:

  · Morten Meier, CEO, has been granted 350,000 share options
  · Ellen Solum, CFO, has been granted 200,000 share options
  · Bartosz Leoszewski, Chief Product & Technology Officer, has been granted
