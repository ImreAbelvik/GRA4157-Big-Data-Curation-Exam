About Desert Control AS
Agriculture and food production consume more than 70% of all available freshwater. When topsoil
degrades, water consumption increases further as it permeates through sandy soils like a sieve.
Simultaneously, population growth drives the need for more food over the next 40 years than was
produced in the last 500 years, putting even more pressure on scarce resources such as water. This is
the problem Desert Control is determined to solve. There are tremendous growth opportunities in a
market that is growing rapidly. Annually, 12 million hectares of fertile land perish to desertification.
Desert Control is a climate technology company specialized in reclaiming degraded soil and turning
desert sand into fertile soil. The patented product LNC (Liquid Natural Clay) is a liquid clay compound
that enables sand and degraded soil to retain water and nutrients. LNC thus increases crop yields,
while consumption of water and fertilizer decreases by up to 50%.
