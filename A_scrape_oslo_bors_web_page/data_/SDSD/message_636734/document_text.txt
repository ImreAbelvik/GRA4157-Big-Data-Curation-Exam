Limassol, January 17th 2025 

The Board of Directors of S.D. Standard ETC Plc ("SDSD" or the "Company") has been informed of an exercise of a total of 10,000,000 share options by Espen Fjermestad, Head of Investments. These options are part of a share option package granted to Fjermestad at his appointment to the position as Head of Investments in June 2021.

The Company's Board of Directors has resolved to cash settle the exercised share options, which means that the Company will pay an amount to Fjermestad equal to the difference between the exercise price of NOK 1.05 per share and the closing share price per SDSD share today of NOK 1.71.
