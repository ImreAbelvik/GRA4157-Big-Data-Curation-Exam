The Board of Directors of Veidekke ASA ("Company") has approved a long-term
share option programme (LTIP) aimed to align the interests of the participating
employees with those of the Company's shareholders.

The programme is discretionary, and the intention is that the participants are
invited on an annual basis. The total number of options awarded is 1,125,000
where each option will give the holder the right to acquire one Veidekke share.
A total of 1,125 Veidekke employees have been invited to participate in the
programme.

To participate the participants must pay 1 NOK per option.

The strike price of the options is calculated based on the volume weighted
average share price five trading days prior to grant date. The strike price for
the options awarded on 16 May 2019 is NOK 86.05.

The options will vest over one (25% of the options), two (25% of the options)
and three (50% of the options) years from grant. All unexercised options will
lapse four years after grant.

The options are non-tradable and conditional upon the option holder being
employed by the Company and not having resigned prior to the vesting date.

Exercise periods will be set by the Company.

Shares acquired through the programme will have a sales restriction on one year
after exercise.
