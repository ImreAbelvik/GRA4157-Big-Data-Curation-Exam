2,150 Veidekke employees purchased a total of 1,162,603 shares in the company's
annual employee share scheme. More than one tenth of the shares in the company
are currently owned by Veidekke employees.

"Employees' co-ownership is a long-standing tradition in Veidekke. The annual
offer to buy shares at a discount provides all Veidekke employees with an
opportunity to take part in the group's value crea-tion in the form of dividends
and increased share value. Veidekke believes that employees' share ownership
creates added value, by fostering commercial awareness and helping to bring the
group together around strategic directions and common goals," says Jimmy
Bengtsson, Group CEO of Veidekke.

A total of 6 907 Veidekke employees received the offer to purchase between 50
and 1,500 Veidekke shares each during the 10 to 18 February subscription period.
2,150 employees took advantage of the offer, subscribing a total of 1,162,603
shares.

The purchase price is equal to the volume-weighted average share price on the
Oslo Stock Exchange during the subscription period, with the discount
subtracted. Swedish employees receive a discount of 25%, resulting in a purchase
price of NOK 100.14 per share. Norwegian and Danish employees receive a discount
of 20%, resulting in a purchase price of NOK 106.81 per share. The shares are
subject to a two-year lock-in period.
