6,564 employees of Veidekke have received offers to purchase between 50 and
1,200 Veidekke shares each. The employees could choose between two alternatives:
Option A with 30 % discount and cash payment and option B with 20 % discount and
partial financing.

2,138 employees made use of the offer and subscribed a total of 1.17 million
shares during the subscription period from 4 to 13 November. However, there was
an oversubscription of 106 % and a reduction was done. After the reduction, the
employees were permitted to purchase between 50 and 455 shares each, and a total
of 0.57 million shares were allocated to the employees.

The purchasing prices were set at NOK 73.22 (option A) and NOK 83.68 (option B)
after a 30 % and 20 % discount respectively on the market price during the
subscription period. The shares are subject to a two-year lock-in period.

For years, Veidekke has worked to promote employee co-ownership in the company.
This year interest has been considerable, and 2,138 purchasers represent 33% of
those who received the offer. Corresponding figures for 2014 and 2013 were 32%
and 31%, respectively.

The purchases of primary insiders, as well as new holdings, are attached to this
report.
