16 November 2021: The board of directors of Observe Medical ASA (the "Company")
has resolved to grant 120,000 share options in the Company to the group CFO, Per
Arne Nygård.

Per Arne Nygård was engaged as interim CFO of the group as an consultant on 10
December 2019, and was permanently employed as CFO of the group effective 1
March 2020. In connection with entering into the employment agreement in 2020,
it was agreed that Per Arne Nygård would be granted options on such terms and
conditions with respect to vesting period and exercise price, as if they had
been awarded on 1 March 2020.

On the basis of the above, the options have been granted with an exercise price
of NOK 8.29, which reflects the volume weighted average share trading price of
the Company's shares the 10 trading days prior to 1 March 2020. Furthermore, 4/6
of the options vested upon grant, while the remaining 2/6 vest with 50% on 1
March 2022 and 1 March 2023, respectively.

The options have been granted without consideration and each option will upon
exercise give the right to acquire one share in the Company. Any shares acquired
upon exercise will be subject to a 12 months' lock-up period from the date
received by the option holder, and all options will expire and lapse if not
exercised within 1 March 2024.

Please refer to the attached notification of trading for further details.
