About Gigante Salmon:
Gigante Salmon is a land-based salmon farming company with its first production facility under construction on Lille Indre Rosøya in Rødøy, Norway. The company’s aquaculture concept is based on a flow-through system, combining the benefits of conventional and land-based aquaculture while simultaneously eliminating issues associated with conventional, sea based, farming, i.e. sea lice and escapes as well as reduced mortality, emissions, feed waste and impact on nearby surroundings.
