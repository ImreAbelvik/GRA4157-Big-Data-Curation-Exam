New Long-Term Incentive Programme 2024

The  Board of  Directors of  BW Offshore  Limited ("BWO"  or the  "Company") has
approved  a  New  Long-Term  Incentive  Programme  (LTIP).  The  programme  is a
combination  of Share Options  and Restricted Share  Unit (RSUs), aimed to align
the  interests  of  the  participating  employees  with  those  of the Company's
shareholders. The programme is discretionary, and participants are invited on an
annual basis.

The  total number  of options  awarded under  the LTIP for 2024 is 800,000 where
each  option will give the holder the right  to acquire one BW Offshore share. A
total  of 6 BW Offshore employees have been  invited to participate in the Share
Option Programme.

The  strike price  of the  options is  calculated based  on the  volume weighted
average  share price five  trading days prior  to grant date,  plus a premium of
15.76% (corresponding  to a 5% increase  annually over three  years). The strike
price for the options awarded on 7 March 2024 is NOK 29.85.

The  options will have a vesting period of three years, followed by a three-year
exercise  period. Exercise windows will be set  by the Company. The options will
expire six years after the award date.

The  options  are  non-tradable  and  conditional  upon  the option holder being
employed  by the Company and  not having resigned or  being terminated for cause
prior to the vesting date.

For  the year 2024, the Board of  Directors has on 7 March 2024 awarded 115,634
RSUs to 19 employees within the Company.

The  RSUs will be settled  in shares following a  three-year vesting period from
the grant date.
