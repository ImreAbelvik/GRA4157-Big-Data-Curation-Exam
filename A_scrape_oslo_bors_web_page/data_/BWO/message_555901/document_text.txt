Long-Term Incentive Programme - new awards

With reference to stock exchange release dated 8 April 2019.

The  Board of  Directors of  BW Offshore  Limited ("BWO"  or the  "Company") has
approved  the award  of share  options under  the Long-Term  Incentive Programme
(LTIP)  adopted in 2019, to  align the interests  of the participating employees
with  those of the Company's shareholders. This is the fourth annual award under
the  LTIP. The LTIP is discretionary, and  participants are invited on an annual
basis.

The  total number of options awarded  under the LTIP for 2022 is 1,849,600 where
each  option will give the holder the right  to acquire one BW Offshore share. A
total  of  60 BW  Offshore  employees  have  been  invited to participate in the
programme.

The  strike price  of the  options is  calculated based  on the  volume weighted
average  share price five  trading days prior  to grant date,  plus a premium of
15.76% (corresponding  to a 5% increase  annually over three  years). The strike
price for the options awarded on 8 March 2022 is NOK 33.78.

The  options will have a vesting period of three years, followed by a three-year
exercise  period. Exercise windows will be set  by the Company. The options will
expire six years after the award date.

The  options  are  non-tradable  and  conditional  upon  the option holder being
employed  by the Company and  not having resigned or  being terminated for cause
