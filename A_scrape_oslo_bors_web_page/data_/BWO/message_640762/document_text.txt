New awards under Long-Term Incentive Programme

The  Board of  Directors of  BW Offshore  Limited ("BWO"  or the  "Company") has
approved  new awards under  the Long-Term Incentive  Programme (LTIP) adopted in
2024. The  programme is a combination of Share Options and Restricted Share Unit
(RSUs),  aimed to align the interests  of the participating employees with those
of  the Company's shareholders. The programme is discretionary, and participants
are invited on an annual basis.

The  total number  of options  awarded under  the LTIP for 2025 is 800,000 where
each  option will give the holder the right  to acquire one BW Offshore share. A
total  of 6 BW Offshore employees have been  invited to participate in the Share
Option Programme.

The  strike price  of the  options is  calculated based  on the  volume weighted
average  share price five  trading days prior  to grant date,  plus a premium of
15.76% (corresponding  to a 5% increase  annually over three  years). The strike
price for the options awarded on 7 March 2025 is NOK 32.19.

The  options will have a vesting period of three years, followed by a three-year
exercise  period. Exercise windows will be set  by the Company. The options will
expire six years after the award date.

The  options  are  non-tradable  and  conditional  upon  the option holder being
employed  by the Company and  not having resigned or  being terminated for cause
prior to the vesting date.

For  the  year  2025, the  Board  of  Directors has on 7 March 2025 also awarded
92,400 RSUs to 18 employees within the Company.

The  RSUs will be settled  in shares following a  three-year vesting period from
the grant date.
