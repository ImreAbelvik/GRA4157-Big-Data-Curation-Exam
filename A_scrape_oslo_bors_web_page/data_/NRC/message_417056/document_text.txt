In connection with an internal restructuring of 
ownership in Segermo Holding AB, the company has today 
transferred its shares in NRC Group ASA ("NRC") to 
three different wholly owned subsidiaries, in 
aggregate 2,480,250 shares, for a price of 
approximately SEK 40.32 per share (being equal to the 
initial purchase price per share when the shares were 
issued as partial settlement in NRC's acquisition of 
Segermo Entreprenad Aktiebolag). 

CEO of NRC Sweden, Daniel Petterson, who is a primary 
insider in NRC, owns 46% of the shares in Segermo 
Holding AB through his wholly owned company Skar 
Invest AB. Upon completion of the above-mentioned 
internal restructuring, it is contemplated that Skar 
Invest AB, either directly or through a wholly owned 
subsidiary, will hold all of Daniel Petterson's shares 
in NRC. Other than change of the legal entity holding 
the shares in NRC, the internal restructuring does not 
entail any change or transfer of ownership. Daniel 
Petterson will indirectly hold 1,140,869 shares in NRC 
upon completion of the restructuring.

This notification is made pursuant to Section 4-2 of 
the Norwegian Securities Trading Act.
