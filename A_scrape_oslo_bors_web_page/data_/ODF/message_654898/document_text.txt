Pursuant to Odfjell's Employee Share Purchasing Program ("ESPP"), approved by
the Annual General Meeting on May 7, 2024, the third subscription period was
completed on September 5, 2025.

The ESPP offers Odfjell's employees in Norway to purchase a limited number of
shares twice a year at a price adjustment in relation to the stock exchange
price. The shares will have a two-year lock-in period, and the price adjustment
will reflect the value of the lock-in period. The purchase price paid is NOK
97.48 for class A shares and NOK 95.68 for class B shares. The price corresponds
to the volume-weighted average price on the Oslo Stock Exchange in the ten
trading days during the subscription period from August 25, 2025 to September 5,
2025. To facilitate shares acquired as part of the ESPP, Odfjell has today sold
