About Inify Laboratories

Inify Laboratories provides cancer diagnostics through ultramodern laboratory
services within pathology. It uses a fully digital, standardized and AI-
supported workflow to optimize quality and response times, initially within
prostate. The concept is scalable and can be extended to other diagnoses.
The service includes the whole chain of sample handling: from logistics, to
sample preparation, to reporting by a pathologist from either Inify Laboratories
or the customer's organization. The report is assisted by our own AI, proven in
clinical studies to have world-leading accuracy. The complete workflow is
supported by a tailor-made process control system.
The company, based in Sweden, became independent in 2022 through a spin-off from
ContextVision, with 40 years of experience within digital imaging for medical
applications. It is listed on Euronext Growth Oslo under the ticker INIFY.
