The board of directors of BEWI ASA has approved a new long-term incentive (LTI)
programme for the company. The programme is established to align the interests
of the participating employees with those of the company's shareholders. This
year is the first annual award under this LTI programme, which is based on a
similar programme established in November 2020. The board has an authorisation
from the company's general meeting to buy back shares for the LTI programme.

The LTI programme is discretionary, and participants are invited on an annual
basis. The total number of options awarded under the LTI programme for 2024 is
1 233 329. Each option gives the holder the right to acquire one BEWI share.
Maximum profit gain per exercised option is NOK 50.

The strike price of the options is calculated based on the volume-weighted
average share price ten (10) trading days prior to grant date, plus a premium of
10 per cent. The strike price for the options awarded on 15 November 2024 is NOK
25.57. The options will have a vesting period of three years, of which 20 per
cent of the options vest on 15 November 2025, 30 per cent on 15 November 2026,
and 50 per cent on 15 November 2027. The options expire after 5 years, i.e., on
15 November 2029. Exercise windows will be set by the board of directors.

Following the new awards, BEWI will have a total of 3 201 281 outstanding
options, of which 1 967 952 options are related to the share option program
established on 1 November 2020 with expiry 1 November 2025.
