In  accordance with  the authorization  granted by  the AGM  on 6 June 2024, the
board  of  directors  of  SalMar  ASA  has  decided  to  establish a share-based
incentive  scheme (Restricted  Share Unit  Plan) for  senior executives  and key
personnel  employed by the company and  its subsidiaries. The scheme encompasses
up  to 300 000 shares and has a duration of three years. The company's liability
with  respect to the  scheme will be  met through existing  holdings of treasury
shares. As of 19 December 2024, SalMar ASA holds 114 554 treasury shares.

The purpose of the share-based incentive scheme (RSUP) is to encourage employees
to maintain a deep, long-term engagement in the company, through a further
alignment of the employees' interests with those of other shareholders. Under
the RSUP, participating individuals will be awarded shares to motivate them to
contribute to the continued success and profitability of the company, as well as
deliver outstanding results. The RSUP will also enhance SalMar's ability to
attract and retain staff.

Under the RSUP, participants will receive, free of charge, Restricted Share
Units (RSUs), which, if certain predefined performance criteria are met within
an accrual period, will be released and transferred to them as shares. The RSUP
comprises three accrual periods of one, two and three calendar years
respectively, with 2024 being the first year. Each accrual period encompasses
1/3 of the total number of RSUs included in the scheme. One RSU gives a
contingent entitlement to one share.

The following criteria determine the award of RSUs during each of the three
accrual periods:
- Award of 1/3 of the RSUs is independent of any performance criteria
- Award of 1/3 of the RSUs depends on SalMar achieving a certain EBIT/kg more
than other aquaculture companies listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange during the
accrual period
- Award of 1/3 of the RSUs depends on SalMar's shares achieving a higher total
shareholder return (TSR) than a defined group of comparable companies during the
accrual period.

Accrual of RSUs under the scheme presumes that the individual is an employee of
SalMar or a participating subsidiary. The total gain from released RSUs during
one calendar year shall not exceed 100 per cent of the participant's basic
salary. Under the scheme's rules, the number of RSUs will be adjusted in the
event of a dividend payout in order to preserve, but not increase, the value of
the RSU allocation.

The RSUP goes into effect on 19 December 2024 and encompasses senior executives
and key personnel at SalMar and its subsidiaries.
