5. January 2018. As part of a reorganisation of the ownership interests directly and indirectly controlled by Kvarv AS, in December 2017, Kvarv AS and the minority shareholders of Kverva AS transferred all of their shares in Kverva AS to Kverva Holding AS as contribution in kind, following which Kverva AS became a wholly owned subsidiary of Kverva Holding AS.

The shareholder structure of Kverva Holding AS following the share transfer reflects that of Kverva AS prior to the share transfer.

Kverva AS is the owner of 60,500,000 shares in SalMar ASA (53.4%). The acquisition of more than 50% of the votes in a company whose principal activity consists in owning shares in a company listed on Oslo Børs may trigger mandatory offer obligations under section 6 1(2) of the Norwegian Securities Trading Act. In its decision of 5 July 2017, Oslo Børs has as the takeover supervisory authority in Norway resolved to exempt Kverva Holding AS' acquisition of the shares in Kverva AS from triggering such obligations.
