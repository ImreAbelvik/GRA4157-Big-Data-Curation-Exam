In accordance with the authorisation granted by the AGM on 2 June 2015, the
board of directors of SalMar ASA (the Company) has decided to establish a share-
based incentive scheme (Restricted Share Unit Plan) for senior executives and
key personnel employed by the company and its subsidiaries. The scheme
encompasses up to 324 581 shares and has a duration of three years. The
company's liability with respect to the scheme will be met through existing
holdings of treasury shares. As of 21 December 2015, SalMar ASA holds 1 180 081
treasury shares.

The purpose of the share-based incentive scheme (RSUP) is to encourage employees
to maintain a deep, long-term engagement in the company, through a further
alignment of the employees' interests with those of other shareholders. Under
the RSUP, participating individuals will be awarded shares to motivate them to
contribute to the continued success and profitability of the company, as well as
deliver outstanding results. The RSUP will also enhance SalMar's ability to
attract and retain staff.

Under the RSUP, participants will receive, free of charge, Restricted Share
Units (RSUs), which, if certain predefined performance criteria are met within
an accrual period, will be released and transferred to them as shares. The RSUP
comprises three accrual periods of one, two and three calendar years
respectively, with 2015 being the first year. Each accrual period encompasses
1/3 of the total number of RSUs included in the scheme. One RSU gives a
contingent entitlement to one share. The following criteria determine the award
of RSUs during each of the three accrual periods:

- Award of 1/3 of the RSUs is independent of any performance criteria
- Award of 1/3 of the RSUs depends on SalMar achieving a certain EBIT/kg more
than other aquaculture companies listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange during the
accrual period
- Award of 1/3 of the RSUs depends on SalMar's shares achieving a higher total
shareholder return (TSR) than a defined group of comparable companies during the
accrual period.

Accrual of RSUs under the scheme presumes that the individual is an employee of
SalMar or a participating subsidiary. The total gain from released RSUs during
one calendar year shall not exceed 100 per cent of the participant's basic
salary.

The RSUP goes into effect on 21 December 2015 and encompasses senior executives
and key personnel at SalMar and its subsidiaries.
