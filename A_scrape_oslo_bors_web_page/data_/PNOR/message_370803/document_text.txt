About African Petroleum Corporation 

African Petroleum Corporation is a dynamic, 
independent oil and gas exploration company 
operating ten licences in five countries offshore 
West Africa. The Company's assets are located in 
fast-emerging hydrocarbon basins, principally the 
West African Transform Margin, where several 
discoveries have been made in recent years, 
including African Petroleum Corporation's Narina-1 
discovery in February 2012, which proved a working 
hydrocarbon system in the Liberian basin. With a 
combined net acreage position of 30,967km2 through 
its licences in Côte d'Ivoire, Liberia, Senegal, 
Sierra Leone and The Gambia, the Company has 
matured its portfolio rapidly, acquiring more than 
18,500km2 of 3D seismic data and successfully 
drilling three wells, one of which was the first 
hydrocarbons discovery in the offshore Liberian 
deep-water basin.
