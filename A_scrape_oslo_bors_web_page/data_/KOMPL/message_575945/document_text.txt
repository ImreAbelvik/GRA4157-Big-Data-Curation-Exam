As described in the Notification, Canica has lent in a total of 16,410,220
existing and unencumbered shares in the Company already listed on the Oslo Stock
Exchange to Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB (publ), Oslo branch ("SEB"), as

joint bookrunners (comprising SEB together with ABG Sundal Collier ASA, Carnegie
AS and Nordea Bank Abp, filial i Oslo) pursuant to a subscription and share
lending agreement entered into for purposes of facilitating settlement in the
private placement. Reference is made to the Notification for more information

attached to the Notification.
