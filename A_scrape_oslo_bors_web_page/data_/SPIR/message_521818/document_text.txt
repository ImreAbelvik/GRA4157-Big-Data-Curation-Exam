Oslo, 30 December 2020. Sikri Holding AS ("Sikri" and together with its subsidiaries, the "Group") has resolved to implement a share option program for management and key employees of the Group.

The program comprises 444,117 share options of which the board of directors the Company (the "Board") can grant 148,039 share options annually over a three-year period. Each share option will give the option holder the right to subscribe and be allocated one share in the Company at the exercise price. The exercise price for the share options will be set by the Board and be based on the market value of the Company's shares and is subject to an 10% annual increase. Grant and allocation of share options are at the discretion of the Board. Each grant of share options will vest with 1/3 each 1 January over a three-year period and can thereafter be exercised during a period ending 31 December in the second year after the last 1/3 of the options are vested. Share options that are not exercised within the exercise period will lapse and be of no value to the option holder. Exercise of vested share options can only take place during certain exercise windows, each window being the 14-days period after the Company has published its quarterly financial information. Exercise of share options are subject to the option holder being employed with the Group at the time of exercise. The Company has the right, in its sole discretion, to settle any share options by transfer of existing shares, new shares or a mix of the two. Further, the Company has the right to settle any vested share option in cash in the event of certain circumstances, such as in the event of a take-over.

Further to the above, the Board has today resolved to grant 148,039 share options (the "2020 Grant") under the share option program. The exercise price for this grant is set at NOK 89, being equal to the market price of the Company's shares on 21 December 2020, and is subject to a 10% increase annually, first time 1 January 2022. The share options under the 2020 Grant will vest with 1/3 on 1 January 2022, 1/3 on 1 January 2023 and 1/3 on 1 January 2024.
