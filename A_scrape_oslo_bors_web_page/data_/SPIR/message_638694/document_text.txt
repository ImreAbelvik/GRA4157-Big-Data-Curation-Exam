Oslo, 13 February 2025: The board of directors of Spir Group ASA (the "Company" and together with its consolidated subsidiaries, the "Group") has resolved to adopt a new 3-year share option program for management and key employees (the "2024 Option Program"). The 2024 Option Program is based on the same terms and conditions as the 2023 Option Program and is in compliance with the Company’s applicable guidelines for remuneration of executive management and the authorisation granted to the Company’s board of directors by the annual general meeting in 2024 to increase the Company’s share capital in connection with incentive schemes.

-	A total of 1,146,987 options has been granted to certain members of management and key employees;

-	No performance conditions apply to the 2024 Option Program, but vesting of the options, and in most circumstances exercise of the options, is subject to the option holder remaining an employee of the Group;

-	The options under the 2024 Option Program will vest during a 3-year period with 1/3 vesting each year. The options may be exercised, fully or partially, from the time each option is fully vested and until and including 31 December 2029;

-	The exercise price is based on the volume weighted average price for the Company's shares as traded on Euronext Oslo Børs during December 2024, being the same time period as customary under previous programs, with an annual increase of 10% as set out below:

i)   1/3 of the options will vest on 1 January 2026 and have an exercise price of NOK 9.41;
