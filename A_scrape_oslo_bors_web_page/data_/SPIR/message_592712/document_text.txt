Oslo, 7, June 2023: Reference is made to the stock exchange announcement by Sikri Group ASA (the "Company") on 10 May 2023 regarding the appointment of Per Haakon Lomsdalen as new CEO of the Company (effective from on or about August 2023 or as further to be agreed between the parties). 

Lomsdalen has in connection with his employment as new CEO agreed to purchase shares in the Company for a value of NOK 5 million. The new shares will be purchased at a price per share of NOK 6.28. The price per share reflects the market value of the Company’s shares on the Euronext Oslo Stock Exchange as calculated based of NOK 7.85, being the 30-day VWAP prior to the Company's board of directors' approval of the employment agreement on 10 May 2023, less 20% discount to reflect the value depreciating effects of the sales restriction set out in the agreement entered into with the Company (the "CEO Shares"). The purchase price payable for the CEO Shares will be in two tranches of which 20% will be payable upon issuance of the CEO Shares and with 80% being considered a contingent deferred payment.

On this basis, the board has today resolved to increase the Company’s share capital by NOK 12,738.86, by issuing 636,943 new shares to Arlberg Invest AS, closely related party to Per Haakon Lomsdalen (CEO), at a subscription price of NOK 1.256 per share, with the remaining NOK 5.024 per share being a contingent deferred payment. 
Primary insider notification pursuant to the EU Market Abuse Regulation Article 19 is attached.
