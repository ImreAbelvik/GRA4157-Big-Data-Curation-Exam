As a step in a reorganisation of the shareholder structure in N59 Industrier AS (one of Sikri Holding AS' shareholders) (the "Reorganisation"), the primary insider Preben Rasch-Olsen, member of the board of directors of Sikri Holding AS, has through his wholly owned company Rasche Investeringer AS on 1 October 2020 purchased 76 665 shares in Sikri Holding AS at a price of NOK 108 per share from N59 Industrier AS. Following such purchase, Rasch-Olsen holds 86 921 shares in Sikri Holding AS through Rasche Investeringer AS. The seller, N59 Industrier AS, is controlled by the primary insider Fredrik Cappelen, member of the board of directors of Sikri Holding AS. Following the sale, Cappelen holds 1 801 281 shares in Sikri Holding AS through controlled entities. 

The Reorganisation comprises the following steps:

(i)	On 1 October 2020, Rasche Investeringer AS sold 8 000 shares (4%) in N59 Industrier AS to M25 Industrier AS (wholly owned by primary insider Fredrik Cappelen). As a result, M25 Industrier AS became the sole shareholder of N59 Industrier AS.

(ii)	On 1 October 2020, Rasche Investeringer AS completed the purchase of shares in Sikri Holding AS from N59 Industrier AS described above. 

(iii)	Following step (i) and (ii) above, N59 Industrier AS will be merged into M25 Industrier AS. 

The purpose of the Reorganisation is to eliminate the holding structure whereby M25 Industrier AS and Rasche Investeringer AS holds shares in Sikri Holding AS through N59 Industrier AS. Following completion of the Restructuring, both Rasche Investeringer AS (wholly owned by Preben Rasch-Olsen) and M25 Industrier AS (a company controlled by Fredrik Cappelen) will hold shares in Sikri Holding AS directly.
