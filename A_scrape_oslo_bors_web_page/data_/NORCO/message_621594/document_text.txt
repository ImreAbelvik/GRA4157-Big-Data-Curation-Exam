Sandvika, 14 June 2024 (OSE: NORCO): Reference is made to the prospectus of
Norconsult ASA (the "Company") dated 27 October 2023 (the "Prospectus").

As stated in the Prospectus, a number of employees in the Company, including
certain primary insiders, indirectly held their shares in the Company through NC
-ansattes Holding AS ("NAH"). NAH was established to facilitate indirect
ownership for 214 existing shareholders in the Company, and it followed from the
Prospectus that the intention was to eventually demerge NAH so that each
shareholder in NAH would hold its personal shareholding in the Company through
his or her own respective holding company.

On 27 January 2024, such demerger of NAH was completed and entailed that the
following primary insiders' shareholdings in the Company were transferred from
NAH to each of its respective personal holding companies as follows:

transferred from NAH to his holding company BSH 252 HOLDING AS. The total number
of 1.327.631 shares in the Company held by Bård Sverre Hernes and his close
associates remains unchanged following the transfer.

NAH to his holding company EGIHOG 914 HOLDING AS. The total number of 1.129.181

unchanged following the transfer.

transferred from NAH to her holding company HENBJ 004 HOLDING AS. The total
number of 140.350 shares in the Company held by Hege Njå Bjørkmann and her close

companies. There was accordingly no change of the relevant primary insider's
total direct and indirect holding of shares in the Company.
