Reference is made to the stock exchange announcement by Standard Supply AS (the "Company") on 6 November 2022 regarding completion of a private placement through issuance of new shares (the "Private Placement") and the stock exchange announcement by the Company on 17 November 2022 regarding registration of the share capital increase pertaining to the Private Placement with the Norwegian Register of the Business Enterprises. To arrange for settlement of the Private Placement, the Company has previously entered into a share lending agreement (the "Share Lending Agreement") with Clarksons Securities AS (the "Settlement Agreement") and S.D. Standard ETC PLC ("SDSD").

Pursuant to the Share Lending Agreement and for the purpose stated above, SDSD lent out 44,085,106 new shares to the Settlement Agent. Following registration of the share capital increase pertaining to the Private Placement, SDSD has now received 44,085,106 from the Settlement Agent as settlement of the Share Lending Agreement.

SDSD is a close associate of Chairman Martin Nes, and the share lending is therefore a notifiable transaction pursuant to the Market Abuse Regulation article 19. Further details about the transaction are available in the attached form.
