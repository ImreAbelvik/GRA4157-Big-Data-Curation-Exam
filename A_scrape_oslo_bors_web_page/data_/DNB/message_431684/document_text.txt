DNB ASA has on 21 July 2017 purchased 271,000 own shares at 
an average price of NOK 153.2623  per share. After this, 
DNB ASA owns a total of 2,290,000 own shares.

The repurchase of shares is part of the share buy-back 
programme announced by DNB ASA on 12 July 2017. The buy-
back programme comprises up to approximately 8.1 million 
shares, of which up to approximately 5.4 million will be 
repurchased in the open market. The rest will be redeemed 
from the state of Norway on a proportionate basis, subject 
to approval from DNB ASA's annual general meeting in 2018, 
so that its current ownership interest of 34.00% will 
remain unaffected following completion of the buy-back 
programme.

For further information about the share buy-back programme, 
DNB ASA refers to the Oslo Stock Exchange notification made 
on 12 July 2017 (available from www.newsweb.no).
