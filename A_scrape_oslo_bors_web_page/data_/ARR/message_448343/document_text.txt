Reference is made to the stock exchange announcement on 6 April 2018 regarding
issuance of shares to primary insiders in Hiddn Solutions ASA (the "Company") in
connection with a partially underwritten rights issue that raised gross proceeds
of NOK 30 million (the "Rights Issue") by issuance of 17,142,857 new shares in
the Company at a subscription price of NOK 1.75 (the "Offer Shares").

A minor correction has been made in connection with the shares allocated to the
underwriters in the Rights Issue, which has caused additional shares to be
allocated to Wollebekkgruppen AS, a company owned by the Company's CEO, Carl
Espen Wollebekk, and his wife, pursuant to its underwriting obligation.
Wollebekkgruppen AS has been allocated 67,086* Offer Shares. Following issuance
of the Offer Shares, Wollebekkgruppen AS will hold 167,086 shares in the
Company, equaling 0.18% of the total outstanding shares in the Company after
completion of the Rights Issue.
