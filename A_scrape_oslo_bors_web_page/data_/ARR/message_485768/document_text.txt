Reference is made to the 20:1 reverse share split carried out in Hiddn Solutions
ASA (the «Company»).

As described in the resolution from the extraordinary general meeting on 4
September 2019 (the "EGM") in which the reverse share split was approved,
Intelco Concept AS ("Intelco") has agreed to transfer a number of shares that
corresponds to the surplus amount of shares caused by the upwards rounding in
completion of the reverse share split. Intelco has also prior to the reverse
share split received 19 new shares in the Company with a nominal value of NOK
0.05, which was resolved by the same EGM in order to make the Company's
aggregate number of shares dividable by 20 in connection with the reverse share
split.

Intelco is represented in the Company's board of directors by chairman , Øystein
Tvenge, and has in aggregate transferred 1,052 shares in the Company, each with
a nominal value of NOK 1, in connection with the reverse share split. Following
this, Intelco owns in aggregate 1,239,188 shares in the Company (including
shares resolved issued to Intelco in connection with the private placement also
approved by the EGM, but not yet registered), representing approximately 8.6% of
the Company's resolved outstanding number of shares and share capital. In
addition, Intelco controls 555,298 shares through its Lombard International
Assurance Policy Account, representing approximately 3.9% of the Company's
resolved outstanding number of shares and share capital. In aggregate, Intelco
will directly and through its Lombard International Assurance Policy Account
approximately hold 12.5% of the Company's outstanding number of shares. See the
stock exchange announcement on 5 September 2019 regarding the ownership
percentage of Mr. Tvenge in the Company, which remains unchanged.
