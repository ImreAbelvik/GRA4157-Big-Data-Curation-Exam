This notification is sent on behalf of four Primary Insiders of Thin Film
Electronics ASA, listed below.

Reference is made to today's notification of a share issue of 5,787,500 shares
to employees of the Company. 4,350,000 of the Subscription Rights (SR) exercised
relate to the 2010 program that expires on 7 May 2015. Thursday 27 February was
the last quarterly report release to exercise these SRs before expiry. Upon
exercise, the cash impact for the employee of the subscription price and tax
impact is about 60% of the number of shares received, depending on tax
jurisdiction. The lion share of the shares sold in conjunction with the exercise
will hence finance such cash impact for the employees.

the following primary insiders who in turn have sold a total of 3,050,000
shares:
  * Davor Sutija, CEO, exercises 2,500,000 subscription rights at a price of NOK
    0.80 per share and sells 2,000,000 shares. After the transaction is
