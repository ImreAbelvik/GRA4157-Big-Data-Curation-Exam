On  19 November 2018, a  certain primary  insider of  Thin Film Electronics ASA,
Kevin  Barber (the new CEO from 26 November 2018), received 23,437,432 incentive
subscription rights under the Company's 2018 Subscription Rights Incentive Plan.
Mr.  Barber was appointed new  CEO of Thin Film  Electronics ASA by the Board on
the  same date, and the grant is related to this appointment. The exercise price
of   the  subscription  rights  is  NOK  0.83 per  share.  25 per  cent  of  the
subscription  rights vest on the date Mr.  Barber takes office as CEO, while the
remaining  75% will vest in equal parts on  a quarterly basis over the following
three  (3) years; provided, however, that  no quarterly vesting will occur until
six  (6) months after the date Mr.  Barber takes office, at which time one-sixth
of  such  75% will  vest,  and  one-twelfth  of  such 75% will vest each quarter
thereafter.

Moreover,  a further 15,000,000 subscription rights were granted to Kevin Barber
on  the same terms as the foregoing  grant; provided, however, that the exercise
of  such  subscription  rights  remains  subject to certain conditions occurring
during  a  period  of  two  (2)  years  from  the  date Mr. Barber takes office;
otherwise they will lapse.

The  subscription rights  expire on  4 May 2023 (provided  that the grant of 15
million  subscription rights will  lapse to the  extent the conditions precedent
for  exercise have not occurred  during a period of  two (2) years from the date
Kevin Barber takes office).

Following  the grant, Mr. Barber  hold or control 38,437,432 subscription rights
in  Thin Film Electronics ASA, of  which 15,000,000 subscription rights remain a
conditional grant. Mr. Barber currently holds or controls no shares in Thin Film
Electronics ASA.
