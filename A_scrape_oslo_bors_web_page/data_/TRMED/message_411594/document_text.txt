Reference is made to the extraordinary general meeting of Nordic Nanovector
ASA's (the "Company") on 12 October 2016 (the "EGM") where Joanna Horobin was
elected a new board member.
At the ordinary general meeting of the Company the board of directors was
authorised to issue restricted stock units ("RSUs") to the board members. The
RSUs are non-transferable and each RSU gives the right and obligation to acquire
one share in the Company at a price of NOK 0.20 per share (corresponding to the
nominal value of the shares) subject to satisfaction of the applicable vesting
conditions.
Joanna Horobin has resolved to receive her full board remuneration, as
determined by the Company's annual general meeting in 2016, in the form of RSU's
and the board of directors has resolved to issue 2,678 RSU's to Joanna Horobin.
The number of RSU's is calculated on the basis of a board remuneration of NOK
144,000 divided by the market price of the Company's shares calculated as the
average share price for the 10 trading days prior to the EGM being NOK 53.77 per
share. Joanna Horobin does not hold any other shares in the Company.
