be secured by a corresponding number of free-standing warrants. The sole purpose
of the free-standing warrants is to ensure delivery of shares in the Company
upon exercise of the PSUs. The free-standing warrants do not give the PSU holder
a right to subscribe for any additional shares in the Company.

in the Company's annual report for 2017 and the description of the equity
incentive plan on the Company's web page.
