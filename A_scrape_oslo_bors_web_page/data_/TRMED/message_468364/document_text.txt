Oslo, Norway, 31 January 2019

The Board of Directors of Nordic Nanovector ASA ("Nordic Nanovector" or the
"Company") has on 31 January 2019 decided to grant 259,000 Performance Share
Units ("PSUs") to employees in accordance with the authorisation granted at the
Annual General Meeting held on 30 May 2018 (the "AGM").

The terms and conditions of the PSUs, which are part of the Company's long-term
incentive plan for employees, are described on pages 16-23 in the Company's
annual report for 2017.

The PSUs are granted without consideration. The PSUs are non-transferable and

applicable vesting conditions. Each vested PSUs will give the holder the right

In accordance with the resolution at the AGM, the PSUs are secured by a
corresponding number of free-standing warrants. The sole purpose of the warrants
is to ensure delivery of shares in the Company upon exercise of the PSUs. The
warrants do not give the PSU holders or the option holders a right to subscribe
for any additional shares in the Company.

Company's executive management, 28,000 PSUs have been granted to new employees
