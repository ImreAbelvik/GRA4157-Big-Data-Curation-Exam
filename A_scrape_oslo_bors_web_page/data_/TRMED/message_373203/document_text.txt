About Nordic Nanovector
Nordic Nanovector is a biotech company focusing on the development and
commercialization of novel targeted therapeutics in haematology and oncology.
The Company's lead clinical-stage product opportunity is BetalutinT, the first
in a new class of Antibody-Radio-Conjugates (ARCs), designed to improve upon and
complement current options for the treatment of Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL).
NHL is an indication with substantial unmet medical need and orphan drug
opportunities, representing a growing market worth over $12 billion by 2018.
BetalutinT comprises a tumor-seeking anti-CD37 antibody conjugated to low
intensity radionuclide (Lutetium 177). It has shown promising efficacy in Phase
1 studies in a difficult-to-treat NHL patient population and as well as a very
favourable tolerability. BetalutinT is fast advancing through clinical
development and with first approval anticipated in 2018.
Nordic Nanovector intends to retain marketing rights and to actively participate
in the commercialization of BetalutinT in core markets, while exploring
potential distribution agreements in selected geographies. The Company is
committed to developing its ARC pipeline to treat a number of select cancer
indications.
