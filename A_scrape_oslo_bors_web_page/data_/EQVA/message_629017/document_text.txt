Disclosure of share lending: 
To facilitate delivery-versus-payment settlement to investors in the Private Placement, Nintor AS has lent existing shares to the Managers pursuant to a share lending agreement as further detailed in the Announcement.

Prior to completion of the Private Placement, Nintor AS held 8,469,323 shares in the Company (representing approximately 11.8% of the issued share capital and votes). Nintor AS has lent a total of 3,125,000 existing shares to the Managers (of which 3,125,000 shares will be delivered to investors in the Private Placement) under the share lending agreement. During the term of the share loan, and prior to the redelivery, Nintor AS' shareholding in the Company will be reduced to 5,604,739 shares (with reference to the allocated shares as set out above), equivalent to approximately 7.8% of the issued share capital and votes. Consequently, Nintor AS has fallen below the 10% threshold pursuant to section 4-2 (1) and (3) of the Norwegian Securities Trading Act, and will cross above the 10% threshold upon redelivery. 

The Board has resolved to issue the 3,125,000 Offer Shares in the Private Placement pursuant to the authorisation granted by the Company's annual general meeting held on 27 June 2024, all of which will be subscribed by the Managers and, once issued, delivered to Nintor AS as settlement of shares borrowed from and allocated to Nintor AS in relation to settlement of the Private Placement.
