OSLO, SEPTEMBER 23 2020 

CFO for hire AS, a company fully owned by Stig Jarle Pettersen, CFO of EXACT Therapeutics AS, has on 21 September 2020 transferred 11,250 shares from its VPS account to the VPS account of Theranostic Consulting SAS, a company fully owned by Dr Jean-Claude Provost, Board member of EXACT Therapeutics AS. 
The background for this transaction is that Theranostic Consulting SAS did not have a VPS account at the time of the listing of EXACT Therapeutics, a requirement of the Merkur market. Consequently, the shares were held by CFO for hire AS until a VPS account for Theranostic Consulting SAS was established. 
Following this transaction, Theranostic Consulting SAS has 11,250 shares in EXACT Therapeutics AS and CFO for hire AS has 42,000 shares in EXACT Therapeutics AS, of which 12,000 shares are held on behalf of Dr Jean Michel Cossery, Board member of the company.
